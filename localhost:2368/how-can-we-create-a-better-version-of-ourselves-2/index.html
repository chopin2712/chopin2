The typical answer to this by most of people is

                    <p>Hi everybody! </p><p>For this is my first post I wanted to talk you about how we can make  cool projects and learn new skills every day and creating a better version of ourselves.</p><p>The typical answer to this by most of people is </p><blockquote>"Sorry I don't have time to learn new stuff, I am busy!"</blockquote><p>But it's is <em><strong>FAKE</strong></em>! You will have no excuses at the end of this story.</p><h3 id="how-long-does-learning-takes">How long does learning takes</h3><blockquote>According to some studies learning takes 10 000 hours. . . </blockquote><p>10 000 hours! It is a full time job for years! But what people don't know with this study, it is that this study is based on <strong>pros</strong>, so 10 000 hours is to acquire a skill at a <strong>professional hyper-competitive scale.</strong> But it's not your goal.</p><p>But to just learn something at a satisfying scale to be able to say: "<em>I am not the best but what I've done is good!</em>" </p><blockquote>It takes <strong>20</strong> <strong>hours</strong>. So less than 1 hour per day for 1 month! It is not so much!</blockquote><p>So there is some steps to do to get the most out of the 20 hours of learning you got. </p><ol><li>You need to set your goal clearly</li><li>Then dividing your work into smaller parts</li><li>Then removing distractions to be focused on your task</li><li>Work 20 hours by your divided schedule, the hardest part: the <strong>habit</strong></li></ol><p>The reason of why is it 20 hours is because 20 hours is the time to understand the concept of the skill and overpass the grand barrier of procrastination and is the most efficient time to learn something. Everything you will do after will makes you learn, but slower than before.</p><h3 id="how-can-we-create-a-working-project">How can we create a working project?</h3><p>You don't want to learn something good in 20 hours but creating a fully functional project without needing to make plenty of other to be ready to create your final one?</p><p>It is my case! I really am interested by the NaNoWriMo contest.</p><p>By following the NaNoWriMo style of things it will makes you more able to achieve your project an needed skill to learn your main skill. Also I know that any stories can be rebuilt from scratch and giving something actually good. </p><p>I also love the NNWM's slogan: "Every story matters...". It is a really powerful slogan that works for other skills too!</p><p>So this is the procedure to be competitive with yourself and create your project faster: </p><ol><li><strong>Define</strong> your project as clearly as you can to have a clear idea on what it should be at the end. Also try to get inspiration before writing and get out your comfort zone!</li><li>Give yourself a <strong>quantity</strong>, for example with the NNWM contest it is 50 000 words, if you really wants to progress you can set a large quantity or creating multiple little quantities. Like you prefer. I already saw peoples who created a music from scratch in one year without doing other projects at the same time...</li><li>And according to the 2 precedent steps what would be the perfect <strong>deadline</strong> for you?</li><li><strong>Divide</strong> your works and start planning</li><li>Tell to your friends and family what you are doing. It will get 2 things for sure: <strong>feedback</strong>, proud, <strong>motivation</strong>.</li><li>Starts practicing your skill every day like you done your schedule. I recommend you to add it into your reminders of your phone and writing always at the same hour in the same place. It will be easier to create a habit. <em>An action  takes 66 days to become an habit...</em></li><li>Get feedback and makes other drafts until your deadline then publish your work on internet, even if you think it is not good enough to you.</li></ol><p>So with these steps you should be able to create your project so I know a french YouTuber who wrote a book using the NNWM challenge. He started for 1 month of intense writing, then 1 month of corrections, then 1 month of re-correction with his editor and finally publishing. He created his book from start to finish in less than 1 year. </p><p>Another thing you can do is creating a group of people to create your stuff together!</p><blockquote>If your project fails it is not dramatic, 1 is better than 0. You acquired lots of experience anyway and you would be ready to try again. This is a great skill alone : )</blockquote><p>One thing is sure, stop over-thinking like me and like you are doing right now and start something you imagine(d), you will correct mistakes later, but don't stop! </p><p>Like said a creator from the YouTube Creator Academy said that she wrote a script that have no sense and she could not even find a title less than  a whole sentence to explain it, after a certain time of transformation she done it anyway and her video was working correctly!</p><p>Note that the NaNoWriMo contest is totally compatible with the 20 hours. Because to write 1667 words it takes you at least 1 hour if you type fast so you are writing more than 20 hours in a month using NNWM. Anyway just do it and be happy of the result because <em>every story matters</em>...</p><p>And of course when the deadline is finished and your work published you can update it, except if it is a video of course.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h2><p>To finish this story I would say that if you want to create something efficient just start and create deadlines and other stuff like I said above, then re-write the story until your are happy of the result. So don't be afraid like I am to ask for support and feedback, it will makes you progress in your style and skill!</p><blockquote>If you really wants to progress in a skill set deadlines to be more efficient! It is the best way of doing things , to have a clear vision on what you need to do and when!</blockquote><p>Hope you enjoyed this post and thanks you so much to read it!</p><p>And like a blogger that I couldn't find anymore (because my memory is  a black hole): </p><blockquote>Write to express not to impress.</blockquote><h3 id="my-inspirations-and-sources">My inspirations and sources</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MgBikgcWnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p><a href="https://goinswriter.com/tips-writing-book/">https://goinswriter.com/tips-writing-book/</a></p><p>The book of the french YouTuber "Fabien Olicard"</p><p><a href="https://nanowrimo.org/"><a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">https://nanowrimo.org/</a></a></p>
