So the goal is to be prepared because there are all signs that this is true. Just look into the GIEC recommendation and other serious studies. They are major, and even with that some people say that these alarmist studies under-estimated the climatic crisis. Â </p><h2 id="what-is-the-point">What is the point</h2><p>The point of the collapsology is to be prepared to this mass extinction, you have the choice to make a collision with a bike or a car. The collision will happen you know it, but you can choose where you go.</p><p>Also, even if there are all signs that this is true, if there is an error, then you will have done lots of things for the climate and you will have saved the world with other like you. </p><p>So we need to be prepared, there are many ways, survivalism, ecovillage, farm. </p><h2 id="how-to-get-into-it">How to get into it</h2><p>So we need to mobilize ourselves and create initiatives to protect some things of our world from this drastic change of society. The problem is that, this is never happened before, and we need to change lots of things of our everyday lives, not only closing the lamp when we go out the room!</p><p>But, most peoples live in cities so one thing you can do is collecting stuff that you will need for your survival. Like food, water, etc. </p><p>But there is a big deal, only by collecting stuff you will not survive for long. So, how can we make an ecovillage? This is not something that lots of people do, but this is the most efficient way to do things. So I am currently looking for resources about ecovillages and how to build them. I know a website who gives little information called "Global Ecovillages Network".</p><p>So I will add bellow resources to create an ecovillage.</p><h2 id="can-we-survive">Can we survive?</h2><p>We will survive but with what life conditions? We don't know yet! So if you ask poor countries what they think about this they will probably not spot a big difference to their usual life.</p><p>Thus, probably we will get the ideal lifestyle to this (I hope to) but It will take a certain time. Then we need to make this time as short as possible to reduce the pain.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>We run out of time! We need to go faster, democracy is good, but we need to stop waiting for politics to solve this gigantic crisis and removing this f**k** capitalism that made us into it. </p><p>We need to go fast. So please take care about this, this is not something that we like to hear but think about how the world of tomorrow can be awesome and different. Also, think that you can realize this world now. You will have two advantages, getting a better lifestyle and realizing a better life than the one you had before.</p><p>Thanks for reading this post and please take care about the climate and your future. Because it will happen during your life, it can happen under 10 years!</p>
