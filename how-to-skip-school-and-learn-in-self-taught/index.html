                    <p>I skipped school to go to a new alternative educational system in Belgium.

I am not organized at all. </p><p>So I have lots of difficulties to keep track of my learning process. For example, I have lots of difficulties to keep track of my to-dos, schedule and more. </p><p>I tried the bullet journal, but I am too lazy to rewrite everything into it. So to keep track of my schedule I decided to create a table with <em>LibreOffice Calc</em>. </p><p>And for my to-dos I decided to get a simple to-do app on my phone to keep track of that. Of course this app is open-source! </p><p>In fact, I got two apps I don't know which one to choose the two are open source and simple, the first one is <a href="https://mirakel.azapps.de/">Mirakel</a> and the second one is <a href="https://tasks.org/">Tasks</a>. Choose the one who fit to your needs.</p><h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2><p>This is a little bonus because this doesn't change too much. I recommend you some nice tools like “Pomodoro Timer” to be focused and manage your time.</p><p>Go in a clear and calm space to work and put some music if you prefer.</p><p>Then start working on your Mind Maps and do some <strong>tests </strong>to check if you understood. You can also re-tick the to-do list when you finished a chapter.</p><h2 id="how-to-test-yourself">How to test yourself</h2><p>Once you finished learning and you are ready for the exams you need to study your notes. By studying your notes you create some better skills.</p><p>You can go into traditional schools to get old exams on your subject. They are usually kept by schools for training students. And in some other cases there are officials mock exams and unofficial mock exams. Of course, it is better to prefer the official ones but in Belgium the official exams are not published since 2011 I think. So I cannot do this. </p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Now I hope you are prepared to pass your exams. I will apply these tips, but I am not sure if they work properly, this is an experiment 😉. </p><p>Hope you enjoyed these advices and see you tomorrow!</p><h2></h2>
