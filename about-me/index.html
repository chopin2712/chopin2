Never stop learning new things and do amazing stuff alone or with other people. But never stop sharing.</p><blockquote>LEARN, MAKE, SHARE</blockquote><p>This is my blog. I will share things I found and things I learnt. I hope you will enjoy them as much as me!</p><p>It's that to be a hacker in some way.</p><h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2><p>My blog contains tutorials and theory. The theory is mainly about hacking and tutorials are about hacking and other things like self-hosting, etc.</p><p>There is also troubleshooting, because all of my philosophy is based on trying I made lots of mistakes so this section is all about how I solved them. </p><p>So this would not be a section you will follow but you can read it to get information about the topic and the context of the thing. You can also acquire knowledge as well as me in this way!</p><p>And finally the last category is the apps. I share you <strong>free and open source</strong> software and apps that I found along the way. </p><p>You can find all of these in the menu Â above.</p><h2 id="why-should-you-read-it">Why should you read it?</h2><p>If you are a hacker, passionate of computer, interested, learner, etc. Then this blog is for you. </p><p>In a way, you cannot trust me for my skill, but you can trust me for my experience. These things help me to remember things I made, I learn along the way, maybe like you but I don't know <strong>everything</strong> !</p><p>I first wanted to start a vlog channel but finally I decided to write a blog because it is more discreet, easy and I can modify it after. </p><p>My blog started in 2019 (this month when I write these lines), I already had attempts to create a blog but I made 2 mistakes, using WordPress and making too long posts. </p><p>It is an error to use WordPress because WordPress is <em>too powerful</em> in some way. It is perfect for complex websites and business portfolio but not for blogging. I also used Medium but it spams to get a pro account and get your control back. I found my happiness in Ghost.</p><p>Also, I was writing very long posts but it was totally useless, people don't want to have too long posts, so I learnt to make shorter posts. Also, making shorter posts make the fact of making posts easier. So I decided to make articles of less than 1000 words.</p><p>This blog is currently hosted by GitHub Pages but the problem with GitHub page is that this is not referenced in search engines. So please if you are interested in this blog please click on <a href="http://localhost:2368/rss">RSS</a> and subscribe with your favourite RSS reader.</p><h2 id="about-me">About me</h2><p>I will not give my name but net's say I am SnowCode. </p><p>I am passionate about computers and electronics. In fact, I am passionate about many things. </p><p>Also, I love sharing things and remember these things so this blog has also as objective to keep a <em>log</em> of these.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>To finish if you are interested in this blog I recommend you to click on <a href="http://localhost:2368/rss">RSS</a> and to add the URL in your favourite RSS reader and to bookmark this website because it can be hard to find again because not referenced on search engines.</p><p>Thanks to you to be interested in my blog, it will be a pleasure to share new amazing things! </p><p>See you!</p>
