So I tried by myself and I realized that a "simple" vlog is really hard to make. On to shoot, except to accept to film yourself but anyway, it is OK. The devil is in the video editing. </p><p>This is not the fact of editing my video that is distributing but the fact that you need to always repeat ¬†the same thing over and over. For example, you always need to remove everywhere where you are not speaking, you fail your sentence, etc. This is horrible, especially when your computer doesn't want to collaborate with you. </p><h2 id="so-blog-vs-vlog">So blog vs vlog</h2><p>Vlogging is the main stream format for the moment on the internet. It has good advantages like being very visual so very descriptive for some aspects. </p><p>But blogging has lots of advantages too! Because we don't talk about blogging enough this i my top 10 of advantages of blogging:</p><ol><li>First, It is more customizable than vlogging, you can change the layout of the page, change the comments section, change the image and more. </li><li>Secondly, you can edit your posts, a video is very hard to edit. You can write in the comments an update text or rebuild your video from scratch. With blogging you just needs to click on edit, change, and click on update!</li><li>Then, blogging is aware of abuse censorship by the platform like YouTube does. So you are the only one to control your posts.</li><li>Blogging is easier to make than blogging, you don't need to make post-production, you just need to write, add image. (For writing mistakes you just need to have <a href="http://localhost:2368/languagetool">a powerful auto-corrector</a>)</li><li>Creating ¬†a blog is also cheaper, you just need a photo camera, a computer powerful enough to support to write text (computers from 10 years ago are OK) and a place to store your server, you can choose free or paid places, you can choose.</li><li>You also got more time to do something else. You need to take pictures but you don't need to film all the time, and take even more time to edit and publish your video.</li><li>It also makes you to learn new things, not video, but photo and writing for example. </li><li>It is made to track logs, not to be a piece of art (this is my point view) so it should not take too long! I did this blog to make myself remember the things I've done and also to share what I've done it has 2 advantages. This is also right with blogging but harder.</li><li>Finally, it makes anonymous, you can write without telling who you are. It is more difficult with video</li><li>Blogging can be done anywhere, in the train, at home, in a caf√©, in the middle of a wood forest if you want to. (Just think about taking good batteries and solar-panels, and to find Wi-Fi after to publish your changes üôÇ)</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-start-a-blog">How to start a blog</h2><p>If you like the idea of creating a blog this is a little guide to help you in this task:</p><ol><li>Choose a server, you need something to write on, personally I use Ghost, you can also choose WordPress if you want to. I made a <a href="http://localhost:2368/wp-vs-ghost">tutorial</a> about Ghost.</li><li>Choose a theme for your blog</li><li>Add the name and description of your blog</li><li>Add integrations, for example you can add comments, like button or ads.</li><li>Add tags to set categories to your posts</li><li>Add pages to explain things like the "home" or "about" page</li><li>Add the pages and tags into your menu</li><li>Remove the automatic stuff (like tutorials posts, automatic slugs, automatic images, etc) </li><li>Write your first article</li><li>Publish and promote your blog!</li></ol><h2 id="writing-a-post">Writing a post</h2><p>This is my method to write a post:</p><ol><li>Do something cool in your topic and takes pictures</li><li>Get a catchy title</li><li>Introduce your subject to make people want to see the rest of the post</li><li>Write a structure with the titles</li><li>Write your body text</li><li>Add your pictures into your body text</li><li>Add a conclusion to summarize the post and give some links to go further.</li><li>Get tags and add a slug</li><li>Review your post, I recommend you the open-source extension called "LanguageTool"</li><li>Publish and promote your post! If you want to know directly if you're doing well you can create a Bitly link to get cool graphs about how many peoples clicked on your link.</li></ol><p><em>PS: Make sure to not write something too long less than 1000 words is good. Except if you add code into your post who are counted into the word count, if you prefer writing long texts, you can write long texts of course but make sure it is readable.</em></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>So if you are concerned with the advantages I described above then you can start a blog. If you need further information, there is lots of tutorials on my blog and on the internet to helps you in this process. </p><p>There is even blog to explaining to you how to create blogs üòÅ.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this post!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arr√™tez-les drama‚ÄØ!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Bonjour √† vous ceci est un petit post en fran√ßais pour expliquer mon ras-le-bol et vous pr√©senter l'avis sur les dramas des Voxs, de Trash et autres de la majorit√© silencieuse. </p><h2 id="youtube-s-en-sort-bien-sans-vous">YouTube s'en sort bien sans vous</h2><p>YouTube n'a pas besoin de dramas pour continuer, donc essayez de vous d√©tacher</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/arretez-les-drama/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5dc9c2bd59f46035ea2fd53f</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[SnowCode]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2019 20:32:06 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bonjour √† vous ceci est un petit post en fran√ßais pour expliquer mon ras-le-bol et vous pr√©senter l'avis sur les dramas des Voxs, de Trash et autres de la majorit√© silencieuse. </p><h2 id="youtube-s-en-sort-bien-sans-vous">YouTube s'en sort bien sans vous</h2><p>YouTube n'a pas besoin de dramas pour continuer, donc essayez de vous d√©tacher de ces dramas ridicules qui m√®nent √† encore plus de drama et de trolls malsains. </p><p>Un conseil si un drama √©clate, ne vous d√©sabonnez pas de la chaine des principaux concern√©s sous l'impulsion de l'√©motion, ne postez pas de commentaires haineux et surtout : allez voir ailleurs‚ÄØ! </p><p>Allez voir des chaines qui ne sont pas dans le drama, profitez en pour rafraichir vos abonnements et regarder de nouvelles petites chaines int√©ressantes.

But to be secure with my exams I want to learn in self-taught in parallel but it is damn hard when you never done it before!</p><p>So this is a post about how to learn courses for exams in self-taught. </p><h2 id="how-to-start">How to start</h2><p>You need to plan and learn how to go to another study life, this is lots of papers. </p><p>In Belgium, you need to sign papers about ‚Äúhome lessons‚Äù, even if you are in private school.</p><p>Then, going to an information meeting at Brussels to get more information about the exams.</p><p>Then, sign papers to say that ‚ÄúThis year, I will pass exams‚Äù. </p><p>In theory, it is like that, but for some special cases there are more things to do, get information at the meeting to be up-to-date.</p><h2 id="your-resources">Your resources</h2><p>You need a few resources to start with self-taught like:</p><ul><li>Focus.</li><li>Getting your to-do list</li><li>Courses and reliable sources for your courses</li><li>Support, having some peoples to help you if you do not understand a very complex topic.</li><li>Organization.</li></ul><h2 id="getting-your-to-do-list">Getting your to-do list</h2><p>To get the to-do list of all the topics you need to learn for the exams you can go on the official website into ‚Äúinstructions‚Äù.</p><p>Once you learned all of this you just need to tick the box. </p><h2 id="courses">Courses</h2><p>To get the reliable sources for your studies and exams you can go on the official website of the exams (in Belgium, it's called Jury Central)</p><p>Maths: Khan Academy</p><p>Sciences: The official instructions paper from the website.</p><p>French: Don't know</p><p>English: Practice</p><p>Economy: </p><p>History: </p><p>Geography:</p><h2 id="learn">Learn</h2><p>To learn from these sources I propose you to use a software called FreeMind or FreePlane (on Linux) and summarize it.</p><ol><li>Get a point on your list</li><li>Search for it in your sources</li><li>Summarize it into your mind map tool</li><li>Study your summary</li><li>Once you finished download exercises on this topic and try to solve them</li><li>Get a flash drive to store all the courses (in folders) </li><li>Tick the box on your checklist, congratulation you achieved this chapter!</li></ol><h2 id="organization">Organization</h2><p> Now you need to keep yourself organized, this is my big issue. I am not organized at all. </p><p>So I have lots of difficulties to keep track of my learning process. For example, I have lots of difficulties to keep track of my to-dos, schedule and more. </p><p>I tried the bullet journal, but I am too lazy to rewrite everything into it. So to keep track of my schedule I decided to create a table with <em>LibreOffice Calc</em>. </p><p>And for my to-dos I decided to get a simple to-do app on my phone to keep track of that. Of course this app is open-source! </p><p>In fact, I got two apps I don't know which one to choose the two are open source and simple, the first one is <a href="https://mirakel.azapps.de/">Mirakel</a> and the second one is <a href="https://tasks.org/">Tasks</a>. Choose the one who fit to your needs.</p><h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2><p>This is a little bonus because this doesn't change too much. I recommend you some nice tools like ‚ÄúPomodoro Timer‚Äù to be focused and manage your time.</p><p>Go in a clear and calm space to work and put some music if you prefer.</p><p>Then start working on your Mind Maps and do some <strong>tests </strong>to check if you understood. You can also re-tick the to-do list when you finished a chapter.</p><h2 id="how-to-test-yourself">How to test yourself</h2><p>Once you finished learning and you are ready for the exams you need to study your notes. By studying your notes you create some better skills.</p><p>You can go into traditional schools to get old exams on your subject. They are usually kept by schools for training students. And in some other cases there are officials mock exams and unofficial mock exams. Of course, it is better to prefer the official ones but in Belgium the official exams are not published since 2011 I think. So I cannot do this. </p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Now I hope you are prepared to pass your exams. I will apply these tips, but I am not sure if they work properly, this is an experiment üòâ. </p><p>Hope you enjoyed these advices and see you tomorrow!</p><h2></h2>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to learn piano]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>OK, I admit this post is completely off-topic.

It has no connection with tech but this is something I learn too, this blog talks about lots of different things. It has no central points and the goal of this is to keep track of my memories and share things with you. So let's go.</p><p>I will talk about learning piano in an academy, why? Let me explain, I will talk you about how to work on your piano. So, how to avoid stupid mistakes? Something really logic but not intuitive to me: listen.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-started-">How to get started.</h2><p>When you start to learn something at piano you first need to do something like this:</p><ol><li>Listen the original song at piano lots of times to get the rhythm and melody</li><li>Divide the score into parts to learn them and create deadlines for all of them.</li><li>Learn the right hand slowly</li><li>Learn the left hand slowly</li><li>Put the two hand together very slowly</li><li>Repeat until you know it when you close your eyes</li><li>Close your eyes and listen to your music, and repeat the process for all other parts of your score.</li></ol><p>You can also listen again to the original song to get inspired. Remember that the goal is not to copy the original, if you do so play piano is meaningless.</p><p>Also, if you have difficulties to focus on your instrument for a certain time and you do only 5 to 10 minute then take your phone and set a timer to your goal, my actual timer is 30 minutes. </p><h2 id="how-to-listen">How to listen</h2><p>To listen to yourself you need to be calm, in the mood of the score and ask yourself how this song feels. For example when I started to learn ‚ÄúRiver Flows in You‚Äù the song made me thought about a river by its title.</p><p>Then, some people think it is not good to do but me not, MOVE! You are sitting down but you can move on your chair to get the mood of the music. To take the same example as the precedent, I moved like <em><strong>I was the river. </strong>Please don't take me as a fool :)</em></p><p>This help me to be in the mood if the music a lot.</p><h2 id="how-to-take-care-of-advices-">How to take care of advices.</h2><p>To take care of the advices from your teacher for example just notice it like a challenge and listen the difference before and after. Playing piano is also a better way to listen to music because you spot differences that others would not spot. </p><h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2><p>Yes, it's true! Who am I to speak, the only thing I can assure you is that I am not a great musician. But I learn, I discovered this few days ago and now I really feels like I finally can understand piano after 7 years in a music academy. </p><p>So if you are like me about piano, hope you will care about my advices and you will give me other advices too, like that I can update my post üòâ.</p><h2 id="conclusion-">Conclusion.</h2><p>So, if you have the same organization issue as me on your instrument, I hope to have helped you. This is my <em>discoveries</em> I am not really competent in this field, I work harder on the other topics of this blog. </p><p>Tell me other advices in the comments below, like that I can update this post. üòâ Have a nice day!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Win tips with your blog using Brave Rewards]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Like I said in one of my precedent posts about Brave ‚ÄúKing of all Browsers‚Äù there is a feature called Brave Rewards that makes you able to get without paying anything and rewarding your favourite websites and content creators on the internet,</p><p>if you use Brave (I hope to) ¬†you</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/rewards/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5dc9724859f46035ea2fd2b3</guid><category><![CDATA[Tutorial]]></category><category><![CDATA[Apps]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[SnowCode]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2019 15:17:08 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like I said in one of my precedent posts about Brave ‚ÄúKing of all Browsers‚Äù there is a feature called Brave Rewards that makes you able to get without paying anything and rewarding your favourite websites and content creators on the internet,</p><p>if you use Brave (I hope to) ¬†you can see that there is a little blue logo on the Brave Reward icon that means that my website has been verified and proves that I own this website, so starting this point you can give me contributions and you can be sure that I will receive them. </p><p>I don't recommend you to tip someone ¬†who hasn't been verified, you can't even know if he will ever receive what you sent.</p><p>So today I will explain to you how to activate Brave Rewards on your website.</p><h2 id="what-is-brave-rewards">What is Brave rewards</h2><p>If you want to know more about Brave rewards you can check the official Brave website or check my other post on Brave. <a href="https://brave.com/brave-rewards/">https://brave.com/brave-rewards/</a></p><h2 id="how-to-allow-brave-rewards-on-your-website-">How to allow Brave Rewards on your website.</h2><p>So now let's see how to subscribe your website into the verified rewards.</p><ol><li>First, go on the official website: <a href="https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/">https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/</a></li><li>Click on <strong>Sign Up </strong>and follow the instructions, you should receive an email with the rest of the instructions.

It is open-source, even if it has a premium plan, that I am not using. </p><p>This tool is called ‚ÄúLanguageTool‚Äù it is an alternative to Grammarly an of course to the basic auto-corrector tool. So let's start!</p><h2 id="why-not-using-the-basic-corrector-tool">Why not using the basic corrector tool?</h2><p>The basic corrector tool is not enough to spot grammar and punctuation mistakes. So It is so useful to me because I am not a native British, so I make LOTS of spelling mistakes and I also can learn some grammar rules about English so it is also interesting at this scale.</p><h2 id="why-not-using-grammarly">Why not using Grammarly</h2><p>Grammarly is not limited ¬†at a linguistic scale and is very professional, I tested it before moving to LanguageTool and a thing happened is that it is not working on my blog. Silly! It is for this reason that I downloaded it! So I needed to make all correction twice, in the Grammarly editor and in my blog. </p><p>In fact, Grammarly only worked for the title, not really useful to me.</p><p>Also, Grammarly is not open-source so when I learned that there was an open-source alternative to Grammarly I directly tested it. </p><p>Also, LanguageTool supports other languages than English, I don't think Grammarly can do this.</p><h2 id="how-to-use">How to use</h2><p>LanguageTool is really easy to use, if you ever tested Grammarly, it is exactly the same thing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-11-14-48-38.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The incorrect words are underlined</figcaption></figure><p>You write and a little circle appears on the right. This circle makes you able to see all mistakes in one place when you write. Also, when you make errors they are underlined, for example, </p><p>When I write ‚Äúizefojoezop‚Äù it is ¬†underlined in red because it is a spelling mistake.</p><p>Also,stop-doing-spelling-mistakes when I write ‚ÄúAlso when‚Äù it is underlined in yellow because it is a punctuation mistake.</p><p>Then, when I write ‚Äúyou works‚Äù it is underlined in orange because it is a grammar mistake.</p><p>To correct your mistakes you just need to click on the mistake, or on the circle and choose the suggestion who fit the context.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-11-14-48-45.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>You can choose the right word by yourself and getting more information about your mistake</figcaption></figure><h2 id="get-in-touch">Get in touch</h2><p>You can get the online version LanguageTool without needing to install it over there: <a href="https://languagetool.org/">https://languagetool.org/</a></p><p>You can get all the add-ons over there: <a href="https://languagetool.org/#firefox_chrome">https://languagetool.org/#firefox_chrome</a> </p><p>The supported platforms are Firefox, Chrome (so also Brave and Tor), Google Doc, Microsoft Word, LibreOffice, many other add-ons. </p><p>You can also get the desktop version for offline use. <a href="https://languagetool.org/#more">https://languagetool.org/#more.</a></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>If you ever had issues with writing things, and you want a free and open-source software to solve this issue then you will love LanguageTool it is both. </p><p>But even if LanguageTool is a really nice tool, it is not correcting your style like Grammarly who propose you to remove some propositions to make your text easier to read. </p><p>I hope this post helped you with your writing task. </p><p><em>If you want to create a blog you can see my other post <a href="http://localhost:2368/blogging/">here</a>!</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[This book "will become a classic of our times"]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p> </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/IMG_2345-1.JPG" class="kg-image"><figcaption>French translation of "Permanent Record"</figcaption></figure><p>Today I wanted to talk to you about a book that comes up this year that I read (binge-reading actually).

This book, that I found in French (I am Belgian) is called "M√©moire Vive" in French and what's wrote under it is "The man who risked his life to disclose the global mass surveillance".</p><blockquote>Nothing will ever be removed</blockquote><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p><em>In 2013 a 29 man called Edward Snowden, surprise the world by disclosing that the USA had the project to collect all of our phone calls, text, emails and more to build a global mass surveillance program, never made on earth. Could be able to look deep in the privacy of everybody on earth. Six years later Snowden reveals for the first time how he participated in the building of this program and how he disclosed it to the world.</em></p><p><em>"Permanent Record" is the amazing story of a smart child who has grown-up "online", a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and the awareness of the internet.</em></p><p>It will become a classic of our times.</p><h2 id="what-is-it-about">What is it about?</h2><p>The Permanent Record explains all the life of Ed Snowden, from his childhood to where he is today. It describes also how the CIA and NSA work so if you like that you will have also background details.</p><p>I will not describe this book in detail so please buy it!</p><h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2><p>When the book came up in the USA the government wanted to claim all the rewards from the book because of the old actions of Snowden.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I don't want to describe all the book so if you are interested in open-source, mass surveillance, Tor, anonymous on the internet, and Snowden itself.</p><p>I am interested in all of this, in fact, my nickname is a contraction of Snowden and Code.</p><p>If you want to get this book you can get it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250237238/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_4oiYDbD3C8BKQ">Amazon</a> or in the library (go in a library to discover other nice books).</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The king of all browsers - Brave]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>You don't like Chrome but you appreciate how fast it is.

But you want more privacy, you appreciate Tor for its privacy but you want fast browsing. Then welcome to Brave.</p><p>Brave is an <strong>open-source</strong> browser based on Chromium so it gets as fast as Chrome, but even more, because it also has a tracker-blocker, ad-blocker and tier-party cookies blocker. So it is even faster.</p><h2 id="fast-ad-free-freedom">Fast, ad-free, freedom</h2><p>Brave is fast because of Chromium and the tracker-blocker. So all ads from Google are blocked and the cookies who go with too. It creates a more readable page and faster browsing because the page is <em>fresh</em> and free from any trackers who go with.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-10-12-22-46.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The homepage of Brave displaying the stats</figcaption></figure><h2 id="tor-integration">Tor integration</h2><p>You want even more private mode, then you will love the super-private mode. I've already talked about it before in my other posts, you can access it by pressing ALT+SHIFT+N. You are into a browsing mode with DuckDuckGo (no tracking with Google then) and Tor (even less tracking).<br>If you activate this mode and do not use accounts and do not download anything then you got an anonymous experience because of Tor, your behaviour and because no data is stored on your computer, so nobody knows what you visited.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-10-12-43-27.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>ALT+SHIFT+N</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-10-12-43-55.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Check if Tor works with check.torproject.org</figcaption></figure><h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2><p>Some don't want to go on Brave because they want the Chrome extensions. They don't get a point. Brave is based on Chromium, Chromium can install the Chrome extensions, so Brave can too. They are well integrated with Brave.</p><p>I use these Chrome extensions: Dark Reader, Sprint Reader, MetaMask, Onion Browser Button (go on Tor all the time), Privacy Pass (skipping the Cloudflare captchas), Enhancer for YouTube.</p><p>So if you are stopped from Brave for the extensions, comes, you can get most of the extensions of the internet!</p><h2 id="open-source">Open source</h2><p>Brave is open source, the goal of Brave is to be more than a user and to control your digital activities. You can get more info about Brave on the official GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser">https://github.com/brave/brave-browser</a></p><p>Brave is available for all platforms such as Windows, OSX, Linux (yeah, love it), Android and iOS. But the mobile versions don't benefit from all features like Tor browsing for example. But they're good too!</p><h2 id="basic-attention-token-bat-">Basic Attention Token (BAT) </h2><p>Finally, the basic attention token is a way to remunerate the other users of Brave. You can buy them or get them by the attention that you have to Brave ads (one per, day, hour, you decide) you can also disable this features if you want a 100% ad-free experience.</p><p>Even if I never saw one single add from Brave or anything else I got tokens. Don't know from where they come I got 4.4 BAT. Note that these have a deadline, to make sure you spend them for other creators and not accumulate them. I love this concept too!</p><p>You can also activate the auto-contribute but I don't know too much about it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-10-12-38-24.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The BAT settings</figcaption></figure><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I highly recommend switching on Brave now!

But what I will talk about today is a unique launcher that is small, battery-friendly, smart and fast (open source)</p><blockquote>This is KISS launcher, it means </blockquote><blockquote>Keep It Simple &amp; Stupid</blockquote><h2 id="why">Why </h2><p>I decided to use KISS because the concept is to not needs to get widgets and sort your apps on your home screen. So KISS is only a few things,</p><ul><li>A favorite toolbar</li><li>An history</li><li>An intelligent search bar (With an settings and application button)</li></ul><h2 id="the-intelligent-search-bar">The intelligent search bar</h2><p>The intelligent search bar can do many things like calculating, opening an app, calling or texting contact just by the name, calling a phone number, browse the web.</p><p>This intelligent toolbar remembers what are your habits it will display the most used apps before the less used ones, don't care about alphabetical order.</p><p>This intelligent toolbar also contains a setting button on the right where you can get the KISS settings and the device settings.</p><p>It also contains an application button, it is a green circle (like the KISS logo) and displays all applications in alphabetical order to be more easy to find apps that we don't know the name.</p><h2 id="the-kiss-settings">The KISS settings</h2><p>In the settings, there is also many interesting. </p><p>There are basic things like the search settings where you can set up your search providers, unchecked things that can be searched. </p><p>You can personalise the UI settings like activating the minimalist UI you can get more information in the settings</p><p>You can personalise pretty much anything related to KISS launcher. </p><h2 id="why-1">Why?</h2><h3 id="small">Small</h3><p>KISS is really small for a launcher most of the launcher is more than 500 MB this launcher is less than 10 MB at total.</p><h3 id="battery-friendly">Battery-friendly</h3><p>The launcher doesn't consume lots of battery but if your phone is rooted you can also have additional feature like hibernating apps to consume even less power in the background.</p><h3 id="smart">Smart</h3><p>Like we said about the search bar, the search bar contains different simple but useful in everyday life features.</p><h3 id="fast">Fast</h3><p>The launcher is small and consumes less battery so obviously as simple it is, it is really fast and never crashes.</p><h2 id="open-source">Open-Source</h2><p>This app is open-source you can get the source over there: <a href="https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/">https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/</a></p><p>Then if you want to install it, it is available on Play Store but also on F-Droid (a store for free and open-source apps) or ¬†you can directly download it via APK on the F-Droid page: <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.neamar.kiss/">https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.neamar.kiss/</a></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>If you're looking for a simple and stupid home page and launcher for your Android device you can use KISS, you will love it!</p><p>I hope this post interested you and you will download KISS if you're on an Android ¬†phone.</p><p>See you!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to publish a local website]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In this post I have been tried to publish my blog, failed.

So I decided to return to basics. The static website. This blog doesn't have something very dynamic excepted writing. All other integrations are tier-party so not dynamic from this website.</p><p>I've already done that with a WordPress website.</p><h2 id="what-does-static-means">What does static means?</h2><p>There are two types of websites, dynamics one and statics one.</p><p>Dynamic websites are like WordPress, Google, Ghost, Medium, etc. There has direct contact with the user, also the server needs to receive a request and often needs a database and JavaScript.</p><p>A static website has no database, no needs to have a server or JavaScript to run. Files can be downloaded and run locally on your computer. Using a tool called Wget you can convert dynamic websites like blogs or business websites into static websites.</p><p>Also in this way you will have 3 backups, on your host, on your computer and on the dynamic website.</p><h2 id="create-your-local-installation">Create your local installation</h2><p>You need to choose what will be your website it cannot be something else than text without interactions. Example: Blog or Pro Website. So you can't have a wiki for example. Your wiki will be in "READ ONLY" mode.</p><p>So if you want an example go check my other post about Ghost, I made a local installation.</p><h2 id="choose-a-host">Choose a host</h2><p>You need something to host your website. You can use GitHub pages, Netifly, or simply on your raspberry pi using Nginx. I will talk about this last one later</p><h2 id="create-a-script">Create a script</h2><p>Now we need a script to convert our local website into static files.‚Äå</p><ol><li>Create a sync folder like "ghosthtml"<br></li><li>Run: (replace ghost-up by something else if you want. )</li></ol><pre><code class="language-shell">sudo gedit /usr/bin/ghost-up 
</code></pre><p>3. Copy and paste the following code into it:</p><pre><code class="language-shell">cd ~/ghosthtml 
wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent http://localhost:2368 
cd localhost*
</code></pre><p>4. Replace the <em>ghosthtml</em> and <em>URL</em> if it's not correct to you</p><p>5. Then add the publish commands into your file:</p><pre><code class="language-shell">git init
git remote add origin https://HOST/USER/REPO
git add --all
git commit -m website
git config credential.helper store
git push -u origin master
</code></pre><p>6. Save the file and allow executing file:</p><pre><code class="language-shell">sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/ghost-up
</code></pre><p>7. Run the command <code>ghost-up</code> to publish your content</p><h2 id="configure-the-raspberry-pi">Configure the Raspberry PI</h2><p>If you decided to use a Rpi ¬†you can follow this guide to ¬†sync the host with the Rpi.</p><ol><li>First, install Nginx on it <em>sudo apt install nginx -y</em></li><li>Then go into the Nginx folder <em>cd /var/www/html</em></li><li>Then sync the repo by running the following commands:‚Äå‚Äå</li></ol><pre><code class="language-shell">watch -n 3600 sudo rm -r /var/www/html/* &amp;&amp; sudo git clone https://HOST/USER/REPO /var/www/html</code></pre><p>4. Configure your modem ports to allow the port 80 to work</p><p>5. Configure a DDNS like Noip to be linked to your public IP address</p><h2 id="use-it">Use it</h2><p>So now your script has been made you just need to make changes on your local install and then running ghost-up to be published. In maximum 1 hour the change will be made on your Rpi, and in max 5 minutes for the GitHub Pages.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Congratulation, you have a fast, secure static website who can work on any device and cannot be hacked excepted the git repo. </p><p>So you just need to run one command to publish all changes! And you've also learned how to configure a Rpi. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ghost exited with code 0]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I was writing the precedent post about Ghost and I wanted to test how to publish this website.

So hackers will probably not think about Master as a password manager, cannot hack it or hack database because no data is stored. </p><p>If they pwned you on a website you are protected, you just need to change the password you have on this website, all other websites are safe because they don't have the same password! </p><p>I highly recommend you to test it with the online app.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Create a Minecraft Server]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This is a complete guide to explain you how to create a Minecraft Server</p><p>You got multiple choices of Servers:</p><p>Spigot/CraftBukkit: Plugins, like mod but more stable and without needing to install it on the client</p><p>Vanilla: Official version and the latest one, no mod, no plugin</p><p>Forge Server:</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/create-a-minecraft-server/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5dc5b47729f4ec2178df3c20</guid><category><![CDATA[Tutorial]]></category><category><![CDATA[Apps]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[SnowCode]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2019 19:26:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a complete guide to explain you how to create a Minecraft Server</p><p>You got multiple choices of Servers:</p><p>Spigot/CraftBukkit: Plugins, like mod but more stable and without needing to install it on the client</p><p>Vanilla: Official version and the latest one, no mod, no plugin</p><p>Forge Server: The less stable and the worst, you need to install the mods on the server and every clients needs to have mods installed too.</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>You need e few things before starting:</p><ul><li>A computer (to optimize: try one you're not using when playing)</li><li>Java installed</li><li>Root access to the modem</li></ul><h2 id="windows">Windows</h2><h3 id="vanilla">Vanilla</h3><p>The vanilla server is the easiest one you just need one file and it is very handy to create a server with this tool.</p><ol><li>Download the server file on <a href="https://mcversions.net/">https://mcversions.net/</a> by clicking on server jar.</li><li>Create a new folder for your server</li><li>Put your server file into it.</li><li>Run it with java runtime and wait a while</li><li>Open eula.txt and replace false by true (then save)</li><li>When the console starts write stop</li><li>Open server.properties and go one by one all settings, and set online-mode to false if you want crack to be allowed.

Many videos are talking about "Mystery Boxes found on the dark web", drug, serial killers, black market, etc.</p><p>Let's demystify all of this!</p><h2 id="what-is-the-dark-web">What is the dark web</h2><p>There are many dark webs. Many peoples have confusion with the term dark web and deep web. The deep web corresponds to anything stored on the internet but not visible with Google.</p><p>For example, your mailbox, if you search your email address on another computer you will not be able to check your emails without login. Then congratulation! You're on the deep web!</p><p>But the dark web is another thing. There are many dark webs and they need specific software to run and to be watched. These are usually anonymous and were also made to represent the <em>golden age</em> of the internet.</p><p>The Golden Age of the internet represents the time before people should consider they virtual life like they real life; when capitalism didn't take the internet; when NSA was not watching the internet to find terrorists.</p><p>This corresponds to the time before this dark time of the 11 September 2001.</p><h2 id="the-dark-web">The dark web?</h2><p>First, you need to say: "which one" There are many dark webs. Freenet, Tor, Dat, IPFS, ZeroNet, etc.</p><p>The most popular dark web is probably Tor. Against many other dark web tor is NOT decentralised. Tor is masking your identity using a special proxy called "Tor Proxy" (very original, yeah).</p><p>If you want to understand how Tor works you can check my other post on how to be anonymous on the internet and how.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-find-on-the-dark-web">What can you find on the dark web?</h2><p>In the dark web, you can found many things that represent the human being. So you can find illegals things but also very good things.</p><p>Private messengers for peoples who are under high surveillance like China for example.</p><p>Platform to communicate sensitives info to the journalists via SecureDrop, in fact, SecureDrop has been developed by Edward Snowden.</p><p>A platform developed by Tor themselves to send data like WeTransfer, but under the Tor network.</p><p>You also have blogs on the dark web, peoples are interested to run blogs under the dark web because it can target a very specific audience, and also because the .onion extension is free. Same things for other decentralised platforms.</p><h2 id="why-tor">Why Tor</h2><p>Tor is not only made to create illegal activities but to be yourself, this is an amazing tool against commercial targeting, censored content, mass surveillance.</p><p>It is like a knife, you can use a knife to cook, or to kill somebody. It is not, for this reason, we will ban knives in the markets. This is only a tool you can use it as you want.</p><p>You can also browse normal websites with Tor of course!</p><h2 id="next-step">Next step?</h2><p>I will also post another post about the topic of the dark web because my blog has not been published yet and what that blog to be available on Tor and the classic internet.</p><h2 id="how-to-go-on-the-dark-web">How to go on the dark web</h2><p><strong>Do not only focus on the dark web, know that you can go, but get the power of browsing the clear net like it was on the dark web because it is! You are anonymous (don't use an account)</strong></p><p>Also, when you search for a dark web link you need to be very focused! You do this:</p><ol><li>Describe <strong>exactly</strong> what you want to have</li><li>Search on <a href="https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/">DuckDuckGo</a> to get something like this on Reddit</li><li>If you not found find a dark web wiki and find the right category</li><li>If you still not found post a request on Reddit on r/onion.</li><li>Go on the website and stay on it, be aware of suspicious links.</li></ol><p>How to be anonymous on the internet not by using onion? I made a post for that: <a href="http://localhost:2368/anonymous/">http://localhost:2368/anonymous/</a></p><h3 id="example-of-links">Example of links</h3><p>To go to the dark web you just need to install Tor on your computer. Or Brave.</p><p>If you use Brave you need to do the shortcut CTRL+ALT+N to open the private browsing with Tor.</p><p>Then you need links. This is the problem with Tor is that without links you can't do anything so I will give you some:</p><p>DuckduckGo browser: <a href="https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/">https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/">https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/</a> (remember that it is not because you use Facebook on the dark web that you are anonymous because you have an account)</p><p>Proton Mail: <a href="https://protonirockerxow.onion/login">https://protonirockerxow.onion/login</a></p><p>The New York Time: <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/">https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/</a></p><p>CryptoDogs (private com): <a href="http://doggyfipznipbaia.onion/">http://doggyfipznipbaia.onion/</a></p><p>Anyway: Get the full list on <a href="https://www.thedarkweblinks.com/tor-links/">https://www.thedarkweblinks.com/tor-links/</a></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>So now you know what is the dark web, if you go on the dark web please be aware that illegal websites come up, cause of the reputation of the dark web illegal content goes there anyway. Sad but true anyway so be aware.</p><p>You will not find too hard content without looking after it but VERY controversial like weed, guns and more.</p><p>But there are also legal websites. And also lots of discontinued websites, don't think it is your connection who is down, lots of websites on the dark web are down.</p><p>When you go on the dark web remember to be very focused and knowing what you want.</p><p>Thanks for reading this post!</p><p>Have fun and never stop learning guys!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
