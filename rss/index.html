This is a new post about a wonderful gift I received for Christmas.</p><p>A kit of the Creality Ender 3 Pro. </p><p>Image.</p><p>This is my setup story of the printer.</p><h2 id="go-to-the-store-">Go to the store.</h2><p>You can get this printer in many shops like Amazon or other but this printer come from <a href="https://www.ideato3d.be/fr/boutique/imprimantes3d/imprimante-3d-creality-ender-3-pro/">IdeaTo3D</a>. I am not related to this shop, this is only where I've bought it.</p><p>Image.</p><h2 id="assembly-process-">Assembly process.</h2><p>Once you've got your package you need to build it, you have a guide that you can follow but you can also search on the web for other resources. Also, I didn't notice that there was a video on the SD card that in the package. </p><p>This is a video of the assembly of this machine:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pu6bJwq60oc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>A French video of the assembly</figcaption></figure><p>I recommend you to use the guide to build it and only use the video when you are stuck. Also, I recommend you to take the assembly like a puzzle, this will probably take you few hours before finishing the building, even if the printer is "simple to build".</p><h2 id="calibration-">Calibration.</h2><p>Then you would probably say that the printer is working but no, you also need to calibrate it.</p><p>This is a small guide to calibrate your 3d printer:</p><ol><li>Make sure the bed (the plate) can move without being blocked by other things.</li><li>Use a calliper to measure the top axis this need to be horizontal, so same height on both sides.</li><li>Make sure the bed is horizontal.</li></ol><p>For the last one, this is the most important and complex thing to do, you need to move it when the machine is off or using the built-in tools of "prepare" menu when the machine is on.</p><ol><li>Move the extruder to the "auto-home"</li><li>Move the extruder to every corner, a sheet of paper need to be <em>just</em> able to pass between the extruder and the bed. </li><li>Test the other parts of the bed with the paper sheet.</li></ol><h2 id="your-first-print-">Your first print.</h2><p>Then your printer should be OK so now, lets print!</p><ol><li>Create a solution of 50% Water and 50% Alcohol. </li><li>Put your solution on the heat bed.</li><li>Install "Cura" on your computer.</li><li>Plug the SD card adapter with the SD card into your computer.</li><li>Download and extract the "20 mm Calibration cube" <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1278865">here</a>.</li><li>Drag'n'drop the STL file inside the archive's file directory into Cura.</li><li>On Cura select your 3D printer from the list, your filament, and your print quality (should be OK).</li><li>Click on <strong>Slice</strong> and save to the SD card. Now you know how long the filament will be used and the approximated time to print.</li><li>Eject the SD card and plug it to the printer.</li><li>Go into the menu, select print from card then select your file.gcode.</li></ol><p>Once the file is selected, the bed will heat to 60° then the extruder will heat until 200° then the first layout will be printed then the print will really start. The progression of your print is on the screen of the printer.</p><p>Then when it is finished you should get an exact 20 mm by 20 mm cube with X Y and Z on the sides.</p><p>If your print stick to the plate, you can use the tool to force it, this will be easier with the solution on the plate. Also, If it is too hard make sure your bed is cold (less than 60°).</p><h2 id="how-to-get-other-files-to-print-">How to get other files to print.</h2><p>You can get other STL files from internet, on websites like <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> for example. Or you can design your owns using software like FreeCAD. I will write you another post about FreeCAD. </p><p>To print the files you just need to do the same thing as shown above with the SD card and let it run in the background when you're away. Just make sure the 3D printer is still calibrated and your cat is away E. </p><p>You just need to sometimes check if the print goes on.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I hope you enjoyed this post about 3D printing, you can send me your tips or your things in the comments below. </p><p>Hope this guide will help you in your 3D printing journey!</p><p>PS: This post is sponsored by nobody.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div id="commento"></div>

Then, I recommend you to install the "vk-terminal" package on Atom to get a built-in terminal.</p><ol><li>So let's start by creating a folder for your app, then open a terminal inside the folder.</li><li>Run the following command, and answer to the questions:</li></ol><pre><code class="language-shell">npm init</code></pre><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/12/npm-init.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>You should get something like this</figcaption></figure><p>3. Run the following command to start Atom in the current directory:</p><pre><code>atom .</code></pre><p>4. In Atom, open the <em>package.json</em> file and change from <strong>test</strong> to <strong>start. </strong>Also, just after licence, adds the following code: </p><pre><code>  "devDependencies": {
    "electron": "^3.0.2"
  }</code></pre><p>You should get something like this at the end:</p><pre><code>{
  "name": "AIP-GUI",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Install any software without terminal!",
  "repository": "",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron ."
  },
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "electron": "^3.0.2"
  }
}</code></pre><p>5. Create a new file called <em>app.js </em>this app will generate the window and start the app, this is the file that is described in <em>package.json</em>. Paste the following content in it:</p><pre><code>const {app, BrowserWindow} = require('electron')
const path = require('path')
const url = require('url')

let window = null

// Wait until the app is ready
app.once('ready', () =&gt; {
  window = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    backgroundColor: "#D6D8DC",
    show: false
  })

  // Load a URL in the window to the local index.html path
  window.loadURL(url.format({
    pathname: path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'),
    protocol: 'file:',
    slashes: true
  }))

  // Show window when page is ready
  window.once('ready-to-show', () =&gt; {
    window.show()
  })
})
</code></pre><p>6. Create another file called <em>index.html</em>, you can keep it empty for the moment.</p><p>7. Open your terminal and run the following commands to install Electron, the NodeJS stuff and start your application:</p><pre><code>npm install --save-dev electron
npm install
npm start</code></pre><p>At the end an empty window should pop-up, this is your app! To run your app you just need to run the last command you've typed.</p><h2 id="create-the-interface-">Create the interface.</h2><p>The interface (basic, without styling) will be created using the HTML file, in Atom you can add the basic HTML by writing "html" then TAB key. Also, I recommend you to instal the Atom's package "html-preview" and press CTRL+SHIFT+H.</p><ol><li>Add the basic HTML stuff.</li><li>Link with the (non-existing) CSS style sheet (in the header):</li></ol><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/style.css"&gt;</code></pre><p>3. Add the future script file at the end of "body": Remember that if you need to run function without trigger, you should run them after this line.</p><pre><code>&lt;script src="index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre><p>4. Add your text and different HTML elements, we will do a very basic thing, an input field, a button and a text field.</p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;input type="text" name="" value=""&gt;
&lt;button type="submit" name="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><p>5. Then, add IDs to make the elements to be located by the code.</p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;input id="textfield" type="text" name="" value=""&gt;
&lt;button id="btn" type="submit" name="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;p id="textzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><p>6. Finally, add functions when a specific element is clicked, these functions will call the JS code.</p><pre><code>&lt;input id="textfield" type="text" name="" value=""&gt;
&lt;button id="btn" onclick="code_submit()" type="submit" name="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;p id="textzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre><p>If you have installed the HTML-preview module you should see this:</p><h2 id="create-the-code-">Create the code.</h2><p>Now let's create the JS code! </p><ol><li>Create a new file called <em>index.js </em>and close your HTML preview window.</li><li>Add the different functions to it:</li></ol><pre><code>function code_submit(e){
  
}</code></pre><p>3. Get the other elements by their IDs:</p><pre><code>function code_submit(e){
  //Get elements by IDs
  var textfield = document.getElementById('textfield');
  var textzone = document.getElementById('textzone');
  var btn = document.getElementById('btn');
}</code></pre><p>4. Create the basic algorithm of what you want to do:</p><pre><code>function code_submit(e){
  //Get elements by IDs
  var textfield = document.getElementById('textfield');
  var textzone = document.getElementById('textzone');
  var btn = document.getElementById('btn');

  //Take the value of textfield
  //Set the value of textzone into textfield
  //Return the result
}</code></pre><p>5. Then, let's translate this into JS:</p><pre><code>function code_submit(e){
  //Get elements by IDs
  var textfield = document.getElementById('textfield');
  var textzone = document.getElementById('textzone');
  var btn = document.getElementById('btn');

  //Take the value of textfield
  var text = textfield.value;
  //Set the value of textzone into textfield
  var display = textzone.innerHTML=text;
  //Return the result
  return false;
}</code></pre><p>6. Your app works! You can run it by running:</p><pre><code>npm start</code></pre><p>When you type something and hit Submit, what you've typed appears below. </p><h2 id="add-styling-">Add styling.</h2><p>Yes, the app works but this is so ugly so let's style this up!</p><ol><li>Create a new directory called <em>assets.</em></li><li>Create a file in this directory called <em>style.css</em>.</li><li>In this file, let's define few things that we want to modify the style:</li></ol><pre><code>#textfield {

}

#btn {
  
}

#textzone {
  
}</code></pre><p>4. Set your expectations:</p><pre><code>#textfield {
  Center
  non-continuous outline 
  
}

#btn {
  No outline 
  Round edges 
  Centered
  LArge
  Green 
}

#textzone {
  Cntered 
  Margin 
  sans serif 
  LArge font
}</code></pre><p>5. Translate that into CSS</p><p>NOT READY YET, PLEASE WAIT!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to install a fully anonymous OS]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In one of my precedent posts I've talked you about "how to be anonymous on the internet". </p><p>I forgot to talk you about Tail, Tail is a portable OS that makes you able to get a fully anonymous OS anywhere.

This OS is Tails, and we will see how to install it now!</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>To begin with the installation of Tails, you need few requirements:</p><ul><li>An empty flash drive</li><li>The open-source <em>Etcher</em> software, <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">link here</a>.</li><li><a href="https://tails.boum.org/install/download/index.en.html">The Tail image</a>, can be downloaded in about 5 minutes.</li></ul><h2 id="flash-the-drive-">Flash the drive.</h2><p>Now, once you've got the requirements follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Plug the flash drive into your computer and make a backup.</li><li>Open the Etcher software (on Linux, just extract and click on the file, no setup required)</li><li>Select the Tails image, select your flash drive and click on Flash.</li><li>You just need to wait few minutes. Just drink your tea...</li><li>If you did it on another computer, you can take it off.</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-access-it">How to access it?</h2><p>Yeah, the full installation is finished, so now how can you access it?</p><ol><li>Power off the computer you want to use to access to Tails.</li><li>Plug the Tails flash drive.</li><li>Boot the computer and access to the BIOS, this is the trickiest step.because this depends of the computer: <br>Some needs a needle to put into a little hole on the side of the computer but I think most of the computers uses the "F12" key. So spam the F12 key when the computer is starting.</li><li>Access to the "boot menu" and select the Tails flash drive. If you got a "Boot Secure error" you can disable it into advanced option &gt; security &gt; Secure Boot the save it and try again.</li><li>Finally, just complete the setup of the settings (like the keyboard, etc) Also add <strong>all</strong> the additional settings.</li><li>BONUS: You can also add a "permanent" folder by opening the "Permanent Volume configuration" app and restarting Tails, when you will boot Tails again you will be able to decrypt the volume.</li></ol><h2 id="wi-fi-s-issue-">Wi-Fi's issue.</h2><p>Then, if you cannot connect yourself to Wi-Fi and <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/advanced_topics/wireless_devices/index.en.html">this guide</a> is not useful to you then I have bad news for you, you need a Wi-Fi dongle to your computer or connect it via Ethernet. Unfortunately mine don't have an Ethernet port and I don't have a Wi-Fi dongle, so I used another computer.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-tails-">How to use Tails.</h2><p>You can use Tails using many built-in apps or by installing new apps (apps will be stored on your encrypted permanent volume).</p><p>The major built-in apps are:</p><ul><li>Tor Browser</li><li>Onion Share</li><li>All the basic Linux apps (Libre Office, etc)</li><li>Unsafe browser (Firefox)</li><li>And many others that I still need to explore, so go check it yourself!</li></ul><blockquote>WARNING! Every file in your classic home directory are not stored on Tails (yeah, that's the point.) so if you want to store these files copy them into the "Persistent" directory.</blockquote><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Finally, if you are curious about how Snowden sent the secret docs from the NSA to the journalists, then try Tails and Tor Browser.</p><p>So in a nutshell, to start Tails:</p><ol><li>Spam the F12 key when boot and select your flash drive</li><li>Press ENTER to confirm and login your persistent volume</li><li>Add all the additional settings and click on start</li><li>Explore and use it!</li><li>Shutdown the computer, everything that is not stored in the "persistent" directory excepted software are not stored on the flash drive and are forgotten, for ever.</li></ol><p>I hope you enjoyed it and tell me in the comments below what you think about this Debian Distro!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div id="commento"></div>

sudo docker run -p 8888:5000 catnip</code></pre><h3 id="publish-the-image">Publish the image</h3><p>To publish the image you need to create a new one with your username:</p><pre><code>sudo docker build -t USERNAME/catnip .
sudo docker login
sudo docker push USERNAME/catnip</code></pre><p>Then, to run catnip you just need to run the following command:</p><pre><code>sudo docker run -p 8888:5000 USERNAME/catnip</code></pre><p>Also, If you need more settings you can put them into a docker-compose file and run "docker-compose up". </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to create your first website]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Today we will see how to build your first website in self-hosted using WordPress.

I know that I made a post about “Ghost VS WordPress” but WordPress is still good in creation of pro websites. </p><p>Let's get started</p><h2 id="architecture-of-websites-">Architecture of websites.</h2><p>This is my view about the architecture of website.</p><p>Your website is powered by the engine who run on a server which is allowed on the internet by your ISP. And you ISP can be recognized into a DNS.</p><p>To get this more clear I will explain it with metaphors. </p><p>Your paper is in your binder which is in a box which is in a cupboard which is unlocked. To get access quickly to the cupboard you write on it things like “youtube.com” or “gitea.com”.</p><ol><li>The website: the files you got for example it could be WordPress.</li><li>The engine: what I called “the Engine” is the way of starting these files we will see it later.</li><li>The host: The computer or other material where the files are running.</li><li>The ISP: Your internet service provider need to agree that anybody in the world can connect to your home through a specific door. </li><li>The DNS: The DNS is the URL extension (like “.com” or “.org”). It gets a such quicker search than <a href="https://172.217.11.78/">172.217.11.78</a> instead of <a href="https://youtube.com/">youtube.com</a>.</li></ol><h2 id="all-in-one">All in one</h2><p>If you are too lazy and you want your website fast, you can get a bundle of DNS, ISP, host and engine in one. </p><p>Some services allow you to rent servers and to install what you want on it, but because we are warriors we will do this, the hard way.</p><h2 id="let-s-get-started-">Let's get started!</h2><h3 id="get-the-host-">Get the host.</h3><p>First we need our host, remember that most the host is powerful, more your server will be protected against mass traffic. </p><p>You can choose the cheap not powerful option such as a raspberry PI (it is a $40 computer) or an old computer. If you got a bigger budget you can get a home server but this is more expensive than the Raspberry PI of course!</p><p>Also, I highly recommend you to use Linux on your device, first because Linux is nice and because this is a very common and easy way of doing things. Most server in the world runs Linux. </p><blockquote>Fun fact: Your TV runs Linux too, if you got a smart TV. Also, Android is a Linux distribution for smaller screen. </blockquote><h2 id="install-the-engine-">Install the engine.</h2><p>The “engine” we will use in this post is Docker. </p><p>A nice thing with Docker is that you can run multiple server at the same time! </p><p>To install Docker you can get the instructions on the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/">official website</a>.</p><p>If you are on Linux, you can get the official guide here: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/">https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/</a>.</p><h2 id="run-wordpress-">Run WordPress!</h2><p>To install WordPress on Docker we will use prebuild images. </p><p>Docker can be used in different way: </p><ul><li>Build: A list of instructions that docker executes one by one</li><li>Hub: An image to run directly from your computer or from the cloud.</li><li>Compose: Running multiple images to make an environment. </li></ul><p>We will use the Compose option, so let's go:</p><ol><li>Install Docker and run it</li><li>Run the following commands: <em>mkdir</em> creates a directory and <em>nano</em> creates a file</li></ol><pre><code class="language-shell">mkdir wp
nano docker-compose.yml</code></pre><p>3.	Copy and paste the following code:</p><pre><code>version: '3'

These are great tools to spy, advertising and also remembering your passwords, etc.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-cookie">What is a cookie</h2><p>A cookie is a little text document that is stored on your computer. It contains a name, a value a domain and an expiration date.</p><p>A cookie can only work on the same domain: for example if a cookie comes from Facebook, Google cannot read it. </p><p>Your passwords are not directly stored using cookies but creates an ID generated by the website such as "s%3AwbxYM8zxZRrkBr8czbpVI_jkHyFSrfBF.3n32H4OPM7%2BauWGS9S17gkWbNa2bjlEFP9IyLwTw8To"</p><blockquote>So, how Google can get information about you even when you are browsing a totally different website?</blockquote><p>Good question! When a website decides to add ads they also add a transparent image containing a cookie. In fact, an image on a website is just like a window to another website, so the cookie is not coming from the website's domain but from Google or other ad company. </p><h2 id="hack-the-cookies-">Hack the cookies : )</h2><p>Now let's hack these cookies, you can automatically block ads and tracking cookies (also called "tier-party cookies") you can use Brave. </p><p>But this is not what we will do now, this quick tutorial works on Brave, Chrome and all other browsers who work on Chromium. It also works on Firefox but this is not the same thing.</p><ol><li>Go on the website where you want to get the cookies</li><li>Right click and choose "inspect" you can also press CTRL+SHIFT+I</li><li>Go into the "Application" tab</li><li>Click on "Cookies" and choose the new item in the submenu</li><li>Now you got all of your cookies, notice that if you click on the value twice you can change this value. For example on Ecosia the number of trees planted are located into a cookie called "ECFG". So if you locate the number of trees, for me it is into "t=1660" t means trees and 1600 is the number of trees. </li><li>Reload the page to see the effects.</li></ol><p>I used this technique to get back the number of planted trees from another browser. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Ecosia-cookies.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>This is the Ecosia's cookies!</figcaption></figure><p><em>NB: Remember that if you use Ecosia you need to make your shields down to make sure that the ads are effective</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Ecosia-shields.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Make your shields down for Ecosia, trees are friendly!</figcaption></figure><h2 id="bonus-install-ecosia">Bonus - Install Ecosia</h2><p>If you don't want to install a new extension but you want to use Ecosia then just follow these simple steps:</p><ol><li>Go into settings</li><li>Go into the "search engine" tab</li><li>Click on "Manage search engines" then click on add </li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Add-Ecosia.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Add the following settings</figcaption></figure><p>4.	Click on add<br>5.	Right click and choose "Set as default"</p><p>Now you can use Ecosia in the URL bar.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>So now you know how to hack your cookies, notice that the cookie-hack is also a technique used by hackers to take the control of some accounts. I hope you will test this technique and use Ecosia every day! (no link with the topic but Ecosia is cool).</p><p>Never stop learning and have a nice day!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div id="commento"></div>

So, it means that you are sending all of your projects to Microsoft when publishing on GitHub. </p><p>Also, you are promoting one of their products. But one thing what is disgusting to me is that GitHub explains how to create open-source projects, but they are not open-source themselves. </p><p>It is a lack of honesty from them to do so.</p><h2 id="github-is-centralized">GitHub is centralized</h2><p>GitHub is centralized so if you want to host your files using the GitHub ecosystem without being on the central server you cannot use GitHub. </p><h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2><p>There are other alternatives too like GitLab or Gitea. GitLab can be quite complex and doesn't look like GitHub. If you just want to have a simple Git host instance you can use Gitea. </p><blockquote>Git with a cup of tea</blockquote><p>The Gitea server is easy to set up, you can do it within a minute! If you don't want to have your own Gitea server you can use the main Gitea server "gitea.com".</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Gitea-interface.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The Gitea Interface</figcaption></figure><p>The official Gitea central server is free, not like GitLab who has different plans to be on the central instance. </p><h2 id="migrate-from-github-or-other-platforms-">Migrate from GitHub (or other platforms)</h2><p>To migrate your projects from GitHub to your server. You can create a server or creating an account on gitea.com.

I don't know if it is true or if it is just a feeling but when I plug my AC it feels better.</p><p>To reduce overheating just run the following commands to install tlp and indicator-cpufreq (tools to reduce overheating) :</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-shell">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp

If you still have big issues and you need a faster computer right now, then try to install another environment like "XFCE" or "LXDE". </p><p>If you find another good alternative you can also install it. You don't need to reinstall another OS to apply it.</p><p>If you have more time, I recommend you to check a specialist to check your computer components. Sometimes you will need LXDE or XFCE sometimes, just changing few old components can solve the issue.</p><h2 id="the-driver-issues">The driver issues</h2><p>Another common issue is the driver issues. I don't have driver issues but if you have a powerful computer you will maybe need a driver to make your computer to run properly. </p><p>You can find easily documentation about this issue because many peoples have it. You can also directly check on the official website of your graphic card to find the drivers and the doc.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>You learnt how to speed some things of your computer, I hope it has helped you to speed up your computer but makes sure of what I'm doing because I am not a professional.

Not the end of the world, but the end of our world. During a long time I believed it was false but now I changed my mind.</p><h2 id="what-is-it">What is it</h2><p>The collapse is the point where our modern world will run out of petrol. So the goal is to be prepared because there are all signs that this is true. Just look into the GIEC recommendation and other serious studies. They are major, and even with that some people say that these alarmist studies under-estimated the climatic crisis.  </p><h2 id="what-is-the-point">What is the point</h2><p>The point of the collapsology is to be prepared to this mass extinction, you have the choice to make a collision with a bike or a car. The collision will happen you know it, but you can choose where you go.</p><p>Also, even if there are all signs that this is true, if there is an error, then you will have done lots of things for the climate and you will have saved the world with other like you. </p><p>So we need to be prepared, there are many ways, survivalism, ecovillage, farm. </p><h2 id="how-to-get-into-it">How to get into it</h2><p>So we need to mobilize ourselves and create initiatives to protect some things of our world from this drastic change of society. The problem is that, this is never happened before, and we need to change lots of things of our everyday lives, not only closing the lamp when we go out the room!</p><p>But, most peoples live in cities so one thing you can do is collecting stuff that you will need for your survival. Like food, water, etc. </p><p>But there is a big deal, only by collecting stuff you will not survive for long. So, how can we make an ecovillage? This is not something that lots of people do, but this is the most efficient way to do things. So I am currently looking for resources about ecovillages and how to build them. I know a website who gives little information called "Global Ecovillages Network".</p><p>So I will add bellow resources to create an ecovillage.</p><h2 id="can-we-survive">Can we survive?</h2><p>We will survive but with what life conditions? We don't know yet! So if you ask poor countries what they think about this they will probably not spot a big difference to their usual life.</p><p>Thus, probably we will get the ideal lifestyle to this (I hope to) but It will take a certain time. Then we need to make this time as short as possible to reduce the pain.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>We run out of time! We need to go faster, democracy is good, but we need to stop waiting for politics to solve this gigantic crisis and removing this f**k** capitalism that made us into it. </p><p>We need to go fast. So please take care about this, this is not something that we like to hear but think about how the world of tomorrow can be awesome and different. Also, think that you can realize this world now. You will have two advantages, getting a better lifestyle and realizing a better life than the one you had before.</p><p>Thanks for reading this post and please take care about the climate and your future. Because it will happen during your life, it can happen under 10 years!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div id="commento"></div>

So I tried by myself and I realized that a "simple" vlog is really hard to make. On to shoot, except to accept to film yourself but anyway, it is OK. The devil is in the video editing. </p><p>This is not the fact of editing my video that is distributing but the fact that you need to always repeat  the same thing over and over. For example, you always need to remove everywhere where you are not speaking, you fail your sentence, etc. This is horrible, especially when your computer doesn't want to collaborate with you. </p><h2 id="so-blog-vs-vlog">So blog vs vlog</h2><p>Vlogging is the main stream format for the moment on the internet. It has good advantages like being very visual so very descriptive for some aspects. </p><p>But blogging has lots of advantages too! Because we don't talk about blogging enough this i my top 10 of advantages of blogging:</p><ol><li>First, It is more customizable than vlogging, you can change the layout of the page, change the comments section, change the image and more. </li><li>Secondly, you can edit your posts, a video is very hard to edit. You can write in the comments an update text or rebuild your video from scratch. With blogging you just needs to click on edit, change, and click on update!</li><li>Then, blogging is aware of abuse censorship by the platform like YouTube does. So you are the only one to control your posts.</li><li>Blogging is easier to make than blogging, you don't need to make post-production, you just need to write, add image. (For writing mistakes you just need to have <a href="http://localhost:2368/languagetool">a powerful auto-corrector</a>)</li><li>Creating  a blog is also cheaper, you just need a photo camera, a computer powerful enough to support to write text (computers from 10 years ago are OK) and a place to store your server, you can choose free or paid places, you can choose.</li><li>You also got more time to do something else. You need to take pictures but you don't need to film all the time, and take even more time to edit and publish your video.</li><li>It also makes you to learn new things, not video, but photo and writing for example. </li><li>It is made to track logs, not to be a piece of art (this is my point view) so it should not take too long! I did this blog to make myself remember the things I've done and also to share what I've done it has 2 advantages. This is also right with blogging but harder.</li><li>Finally, it makes anonymous, you can write without telling who you are. It is more difficult with video</li><li>Blogging can be done anywhere, in the train, at home, in a café, in the middle of a wood forest if you want to. (Just think about taking good batteries and solar-panels, and to find Wi-Fi after to publish your changes 🙂)</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-start-a-blog">How to start a blog</h2><p>If you like the idea of creating a blog this is a little guide to help you in this task:</p><ol><li>Choose a server, you need something to write on, personally I use Ghost, you can also choose WordPress if you want to. I made a <a href="http://localhost:2368/wp-vs-ghost">tutorial</a> about Ghost.</li><li>Choose a theme for your blog</li><li>Add the name and description of your blog</li><li>Add integrations, for example you can add comments, like button or ads.</li><li>Add tags to set categories to your posts</li><li>Add pages to explain things like the "home" or "about" page</li><li>Add the pages and tags into your menu</li><li>Remove the automatic stuff (like tutorials posts, automatic slugs, automatic images, etc) </li><li>Write your first article</li><li>Publish and promote your blog!</li></ol><h2 id="writing-a-post">Writing a post</h2><p>This is my method to write a post:</p><ol><li>Do something cool in your topic and takes pictures</li><li>Get a catchy title</li><li>Introduce your subject to make people want to see the rest of the post</li><li>Write a structure with the titles</li><li>Write your body text</li><li>Add your pictures into your body text</li><li>Add a conclusion to summarize the post and give some links to go further.</li><li>Get tags and add a slug</li><li>Review your post, I recommend you the open-source extension called "LanguageTool"</li><li>Publish and promote your post! If you want to know directly if you're doing well you can create a Bitly link to get cool graphs about how many peoples clicked on your link.</li></ol><p><em>PS: Make sure to not write something too long less than 1000 words is good. Except if you add code into your post who are counted into the word count, if you prefer writing long texts, you can write long texts of course but make sure it is readable.</em></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>So if you are concerned with the advantages I described above then you can start a blog. If you need further information, there is lots of tutorials on my blog and on the internet to helps you in this process. </p><p>There is even blog to explaining to you how to create blogs 😁.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this post!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div id="commento"></div>

Profitez en pour aller voir le bon côté de YouTube.</p><h2 id="il-n-y-a-plus-que-de-la-merde-sur-youtube-aujourd-hui">Il n'y a plus que de la merde sur YouTube aujourd'hui</h2><p>Si c'est ce que vous pensez, détrompez-vous. L'onglet tendance n'est pas représentatif du contenu de YouTube, contrairement à la TV vous avez le choix de ce que vous allez regarder ou pas sur internet. Profitez-en !  C'est vous qui devez rechercher sur YouTube pas activer la lecture automatique et consommer comme à la TV.</p><p>Donc recherchez, vous aller trouver, il y a tant de contenu aujourd'hui sur internet.</p><p>Le problème qui est extrêmement contradictoire c'est que beaucoup de gens râlent car "il n'y a plus que de la merde sur YouTube et en même temps ont critiqué la télé.</p><p>Ils ont probablement déjà dit que l'on peut choisir ce que l'on regarde contrairement à la télé.</p><p>Donc profitez-en bordel !</p><h2 id="les-bonnes-chaines">Les bonnes chaines</h2><p>Voici ma liste personnelle que vous pouvez étoffer avec vos propositions de bonnes chaines YouTube à découvrir :</p><ul><li>MrSuicidSheep (pas une petite chaine mais une grosse chaine américaine de musique)</li><li>Daenys Horror Story (Une chaine d'histoires d'horreurs assez cools)</li></ul><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>C'était un très court article pour vous exprimer mon ras-le-bol vis-a-vis des dramas trimestriels sur YouTube. Que vous soyez informés, ok. Mais pas la peine de vous créer une armée imaginaire contre la personne concernée. </p><p>Ainsi profitez en pour vous focaliser sur les chaines que vous aimez par sur celles que voue détestez, pour avoir un prétexte de les détester encore plus. Faites cela pendant 1 à 2 semaines le temps que les gens se calment, même si vous pouvez profiter du contenu toute l'année bien sûr !</p><p>Ainsi voici mon avis sur les dramas et j'espère que la prochaine fois, vous ne ferez pas comme moi quand j'étais gosse.</p><p>Merci d'avoir lu ce post.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div id="commento"></div>

But to be secure with my exams I want to learn in self-taught in parallel but it is damn hard when you never done it before!</p><p>So this is a post about how to learn courses for exams in self-taught. </p><h2 id="how-to-start">How to start</h2><p>You need to plan and learn how to go to another study life, this is lots of papers. </p><p>In Belgium, you need to sign papers about “home lessons”, even if you are in private school.</p><p>Then, going to an information meeting at Brussels to get more information about the exams.</p><p>Then, sign papers to say that “This year, I will pass exams”. </p><p>In theory, it is like that, but for some special cases there are more things to do, get information at the meeting to be up-to-date.</p><h2 id="your-resources">Your resources</h2><p>You need a few resources to start with self-taught like:</p><ul><li>Focus.</li><li>Getting your to-do list</li><li>Courses and reliable sources for your courses</li><li>Support, having some peoples to help you if you do not understand a very complex topic.</li><li>Organization.</li></ul><h2 id="getting-your-to-do-list">Getting your to-do list</h2><p>To get the to-do list of all the topics you need to learn for the exams you can go on the official website into “instructions”.</p><p>Once you learned all of this you just need to tick the box. </p><h2 id="courses">Courses</h2><p>To get the reliable sources for your studies and exams you can go on the official website of the exams (in Belgium, it's called Jury Central)</p><p>Maths: Khan Academy</p><p>Sciences: The official instructions paper from the website.</p><p>French: Don't know</p><p>English: Practice</p><p>Economy: </p><p>History: </p><p>Geography:</p><h2 id="learn">Learn</h2><p>To learn from these sources I propose you to use a software called FreeMind or FreePlane (on Linux) and summarize it.</p><ol><li>Get a point on your list</li><li>Search for it in your sources</li><li>Summarize it into your mind map tool</li><li>Study your summary</li><li>Once you finished download exercises on this topic and try to solve them</li><li>Get a flash drive to store all the courses (in folders) </li><li>Tick the box on your checklist, congratulation you achieved this chapter!</li></ol><h2 id="organization">Organization</h2><p> Now you need to keep yourself organized, this is my big issue. I am not organized at all. </p><p>So I have lots of difficulties to keep track of my learning process. For example, I have lots of difficulties to keep track of my to-dos, schedule and more. </p><p>I tried the bullet journal, but I am too lazy to rewrite everything into it. So to keep track of my schedule I decided to create a table with <em>LibreOffice Calc</em>. </p><p>And for my to-dos I decided to get a simple to-do app on my phone to keep track of that. Of course this app is open-source! </p><p>In fact, I got two apps I don't know which one to choose the two are open source and simple, the first one is <a href="https://mirakel.azapps.de/">Mirakel</a> and the second one is <a href="https://tasks.org/">Tasks</a>. Choose the one who fit to your needs.</p><h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2><p>This is a little bonus because this doesn't change too much. I recommend you some nice tools like “Pomodoro Timer” to be focused and manage your time.</p><p>Go in a clear and calm space to work and put some music if you prefer.</p><p>Then start working on your Mind Maps and do some <strong>tests </strong>to check if you understood. You can also re-tick the to-do list when you finished a chapter.</p><h2 id="how-to-test-yourself">How to test yourself</h2><p>Once you finished learning and you are ready for the exams you need to study your notes. By studying your notes you create some better skills.</p><p>You can go into traditional schools to get old exams on your subject. They are usually kept by schools for training students. And in some other cases there are officials mock exams and unofficial mock exams. Of course, it is better to prefer the official ones but in Belgium the official exams are not published since 2011 I think. So I cannot do this. </p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Now I hope you are prepared to pass your exams. I will apply these tips, but I am not sure if they work properly, this is an experiment 😉. </p><p>Hope you enjoyed these advices and see you tomorrow!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div id="commento"></div>

It has no connection with tech but this is something I learn too, this blog talks about lots of different things. It has no central points and the goal of this is to keep track of my memories and share things with you. So let's go.</p><p>I will talk about learning piano in an academy, why? Let me explain, I will talk you about how to work on your piano. So, how to avoid stupid mistakes? Something really logic but not intuitive to me: listen.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-started-">How to get started.</h2><p>When you start to learn something at piano you first need to do something like this:</p><ol><li>Listen the original song at piano lots of times to get the rhythm and melody</li><li>Divide the score into parts to learn them and create deadlines for all of them.</li><li>Learn the right hand slowly</li><li>Learn the left hand slowly</li><li>Put the two hand together very slowly</li><li>Repeat until you know it when you close your eyes</li><li>Close your eyes and listen to your music, and repeat the process for all other parts of your score.</li></ol><p>You can also listen again to the original song to get inspired. Remember that the goal is not to copy the original, if you do so play piano is meaningless.</p><p>Also, if you have difficulties to focus on your instrument for a certain time and you do only 5 to 10 minute then take your phone and set a timer to your goal, my actual timer is 30 minutes. </p><h2 id="how-to-listen">How to listen</h2><p>To listen to yourself you need to be calm, in the mood of the score and ask yourself how this song feels. For example when I started to learn “River Flows in You” the song made me thought about a river by its title.</p><p>Then, some people think it is not good to do but me not, MOVE! You are sitting down but you can move on your chair to get the mood of the music. To take the same example as the precedent, I moved like <em><strong>I was the river. </strong>Please don't take me as a fool :)</em></p><p>This help me to be in the mood if the music a lot.</p><h2 id="how-to-take-care-of-advices-">How to take care of advices.</h2><p>To take care of the advices from your teacher for example just notice it like a challenge and listen the difference before and after. Playing piano is also a better way to listen to music because you spot differences that others would not spot. </p><h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2><p>Yes, it's true! Who am I to speak, the only thing I can assure you is that I am not a great musician. But I learn, I discovered this few days ago and now I really feels like I finally can understand piano after 7 years in a music academy. </p><p>So if you are like me about piano, hope you will care about my advices and you will give me other advices too, like that I can update my post 😉.</p><h2 id="conclusion-">Conclusion.</h2><p>So, if you have the same organization issue as me on your instrument, I hope to have helped you. This is my <em>discoveries</em> I am not really competent in this field, I work harder on the other topics of this blog. </p><p>Tell me other advices in the comments below, like that I can update this post. 😉 Have a nice day!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div id="commento"></div>
