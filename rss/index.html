So I decided to return to basics. The static website. This blog doesn't have something very dynamic excepted writing. All other integrations are tier-party so not dynamic from this website.</p><p>I've already done that with a WordPress website.</p><h2 id="what-does-static-means">What does static means?</h2><p>There is two types of websites, dynamics one and statics one.</p><p>Dynamic websites are like WordPress, Google, Ghost, Medium, etc. There have direct contact with the user, also the server needs to take a request and often needs a database and JavaScript.</p><p>A static website has no database, no needs to have a server or JavaScript to run. Files can be downloaded and run locally on your computer. Using a tool called wget you can convert dynamic websites like blogs or business websites into static websites.</p><p>Also by this way you will have 3 backups, on your host, on your computer and on the dynamic website.</p><h2 id="create-your-local-installation">Create your local installation</h2><p>You need to choose what will be your website it cannot be something else than text without interactions. Example: Blog or Pro Website. So you can't have a wiki for example. You wiki will be in "READ ONLY" mode.</p><p>So if you want an example go check my other post about ghost, I made a local installation.</p><h2 id="choose-a-host">Choose a host</h2><p>You need something to host your website. You can use GitHub pages, Netifly, or simply on your raspberry pi using nginx. I will talk about this last one later</p><h2 id="create-a-script">Create a script</h2><p>Now we need script to convert our local website into static files.‌</p><ol><li>Create a sync folder like "ghosthtml"<br></li><li>Run: (replace ghost-up by something else if you want. )</li></ol><pre><code class="language-shell">sudo gedit /usr/bin/ghost-up 
</code></pre><p>3. Copy and paste the following code into it:</p><pre><code class="language-shell">cd ~/ghosthtml 
wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent http://localhost:2368 
cd localhost*
</code></pre><p>4. Replace the ghosthtml and url if it's not correct to you</p><p>5. Then add the publish commands into your file:</p><pre><code class="language-shell">git init
git remote add origin https://HOST/USER/REPO
git add --all
git commit -m website
git config credential.helper store
git push -u origin master
</code></pre><p>6. Save the file and allow executing file:</p><pre><code class="language-shell">sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/ghost-up
</code></pre><p>7. Run the command <code>ghost-up</code> to publish your content</p><h2 id="configure-the-raspberry-pi">Configure the Raspberry PI</h2><p>If you decided to use a Rpi  you can follow this guide to  sync the host with the Rpi.</p><ol><li>First install nginx on it <em>sudo apt install nginx -y</em></li><li>Then go into the nginx folder <em>cd /var/www/html</em></li><li>Then sync the repo by running the following commands:‌‌</li></ol><pre><code class="language-shell">watch -n 3600 sudo rm -r /var/www/html/* &amp;&amp; sudo git clone https://HOST/USER/REPO /var/www/html</code></pre><p>4. Configure your modem ports to allow the port 80 to work</p><p>5. Configure a DDNS like noip to be linked to your public IP address</p><h2 id="use-it">Use it</h2><p>So now you script has been made you just need to make changes on your local install and then running ghost-up to be published. In maximum 1 hour the change will be made on your Rpi, and in max 5 minutes for the GitHub Pages.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Congratulation, you have a fast, secure static website who can work on any device and cannot be hacked excepted the git repo. </p><p>So you just needs to run one command to publish all changes! And you've also learn how to configure a Rpi. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ghost exited with code 0]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I was writing the precedent post about Ghost and I wanted to test how to publish this blog.

If you want a full easy-to-make business website I recommend you to use Wordpress but if you just want to blog and having few pages then go on Ghost! </p><p>Many people would say that Medium is made for that too, but Ghost is open source, completly free, hackable and can support other intgrations than Medium. Also you are completly free from a depending authority with Ghost because you host your website yourself!</p><h2 id="how-to-install-ghost-under-test-env">How to install ghost UNDER TEST ENV</h2><p>Recently the Ghost v3 version has been released and I upgraded my website to this v3 very quickly.

</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If you got errors like me you just needs to restart the command, at the second time it should works.</p><p>Then you just needs to create a new instance: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-shell">mkdir ghost

The problem is that is not sync with other devices. Like Keepass</p><p>Another type is the most popular is the online registration based manager like Lastpass for example. The problem is that many of them are getting hacked and all your passwords pwned. So I don't recommend this option.</p><p>So the last type is unique, I only had observed is called "Master". It works with cryptography and encryption of your passwords.</p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>Master works with 4 data, the username, the password, the website name, the encryption settings (like long password, short password, maximum, pin, etc)</p><p>So it creates a hash with all of these data when you enter the website URL for example. </p><p>So by this way it is sync to all devices on earth by the power of mathematics!</p><h2 id="how-to-install">How to install</h2><p>You can install Master on every platforms, even just online! </p><p>This is the link to the official website: <a href="https://masterpassword.app/">https://masterpassword.app/</a></p><p>Give it a try on this website: <a href="https://js.masterpassword.app/">https://js.masterpassword.app/</a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot_2019-11-08-Master-Password---Secure-your-life--forget-your-passwords--1-.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>"Login" interface</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot_2019-11-08-Master-Password---Secure-your-life--forget-your-passwords-.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Getting password interface</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-to-use">How to use</h2><p>You can use it very easly</p><ol><li>Login and create an account at the same time by typing your real name, the master password (the one you will remember)</li><li>Type the website's URL like "twitter.com" </li><li>Copy and paste the calculated password to login and close the window.</li></ol><h2 id="negative-point">Negative point</h2><p>One thing I wanted to have with this is an addon and plugin so you will just have to right click and click on login, then right click and click on password, give your master password and then click on login. </p><p>Because on all version the password is shown on clear on the screen which is weird for a password. Immagine write "paypal.com" and your password is wrote just above to any peoples who are near to your screen.</p><p>Another thing is that the mobile app is not setup like the desktop and online one, it is set to "Maximum Security" setting by default but on desktop and online it is set on "Long Password" settings, so when you add a password on your phone, do not forget to change the settings.</p><h2 id="get-the-source">Get the source</h2><p>This is an open source software you can get the source over there: <a href="https://github.com/Lyndir/MasterPassword">https://github.com/Lyndir/MasterPassword</a></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>This password manager is sync by maths and very easy to use. protected by maths and not known. So hackers will probably not think about Master as password manager, cannot hack it or hack database because no data is stored. </p><p>If they pwned you on a website you are protected, you just needs to change the password you have on this website, all other websites are safe because they don't have the same password! </p><p>I highly recommends you to test it with the online app.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Create a Minecraft Server]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This is a complete guide to explain you how to create a Minecraft Server</p><p>You got multiple choices of Servers:</p><p>Spigot/CraftBukkit: Plugins, like mod but more stable and without needing to install it on the client</p><p>Vanilla: Official version and the latest one, no mod, no plugin</p><p>Forge Server:</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/create-a-minecraft-server/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5dc5b47729f4ec2178df3c20</guid><category><![CDATA[Tutorial]]></category><category><![CDATA[Apps]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[SnowCode]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2019 19:26:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a complete guide to explain you how to create a Minecraft Server</p><p>You got multiple choices of Servers:</p><p>Spigot/CraftBukkit: Plugins, like mod but more stable and without needing to install it on the client</p><p>Vanilla: Official version and the latest one, no mod, no plugin</p><p>Forge Server: The less stable and the worst, you need to install the mods on the server and every clients needs to have mods installed too.</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>You needs few things before starting:</p><ul><li>A computer (to optimize: try one you're not using when playing)</li><li>Java installed</li><li>Root access to the modem</li></ul><h2 id="windows">Windows</h2><h3 id="vanilla">Vanilla</h3><p>The vanilla server is the easiest one you just needs one file and it is very handy to create a server with this tool.</p><ol><li>Download the server file on <a href="https://mcversions.net/">https://mcversions.net/</a> by clicking on server jar.</li><li>Create a new folder for your server</li><li>Put your server file into it.</li><li>Run it with java runtime and wait a while</li><li>Open eula.txt and replace false by true (then save)</li><li>When the console starts write stop</li><li>Open server.properties and go one by one all settings, and set online-mode to false if you want cracks to be allowed.

Many videos are talking about "Mystery Boxes found on the dark net", drug, serial killers, black market, etc.</p><p>Let's demystify all of this!</p><h2 id="what-is-dark-net">What is dark net</h2><p>There is actually many dark nets. Many peoples have confusion with the term dark net and deep web. The deep web correspond to anything stored on the internet but not visible with Google. </p><p>For example, your mailbox, if you search your email address on another computer you will not be able to check your emails without having login. Then congratulation! You're on the deep web!</p><p>But the dark net is another thing. There is many dark net and they needs a specific software to run and to be watched. These are usually anonymous and where also made to represent the <em>golden age</em> of internet.</p><p>The Golden Age of internet represents the time before people should consider they virtual life like they real life; when capitalism didn't took internet; when NSA was not watching the internet to find terrorists. </p><p>This correspond to the time before this dark time of the 11 September 2001. </p><h2 id="dark-net">Dark net?</h2><p>First you need to say: "which one" There is many dark nets. Freenet, Tor, Dat, IPFS, ZeroNet, etc.</p><p>The most oppular darknet is probably Tor. Against many other darknets tor is NOT decentralized. Tor is masking your indentity using a special proxy called "Tor Proxy" (very original, yeah). </p><p>If you want to understand how Tor works you can check my other post on how to be anonymous on internet and how.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-find-on-the-darknet">What can you find on the darknet?</h2><p>In the darknet you can found many things that represents the human being. So you can find illegals things but also very good things. </p><p>Private emssengers for peoples who are under high surveillance like China for example.</p><p>Platform to communicate sensitives infos to the journalists via SecureDrop, in fact SecureDrop has  been devlopped by Edward Snowden. </p><p>A platform devloped by Tor themselves to send data like WeTransfer, but under the Tor network.</p><p>You also have blogs on the darknet, peoples are interrested to run blogs under the darknet because it can target a very specific audience, and also because the .onion extension is free. Same things for other decentralized platforms.</p><h2 id="why-tor">Why Tor</h2><p>Tor is not only made to cerate illegal activites but to be yourself, this is an amazing tool aigainst commercial targeting, censored content, mass sureillance. </p><p>It is like an knife, you can use a knife to cook, or to kill somebody. It is not for this reason we will ban knifes in the markets. This is only a tool you can use it like you want.</p><p>You can also browse normal websites with Tor of course!</p><h2 id="next-step">Next step?</h2><p>I will also post another post about the topic of the darknet because by blog has not been published yet and what that blog to be avaiable on Tor and on the classic internet. </p><h2 id="how-to-go-on-the-dark-web">How to go on the dark web</h2><p><strong>Do not only focus on dark net, know that you can go, but get power of browsing the clear net like it was on dark net, because it is! You are anonymous (don't use an account)</strong></p><p>Also when you search for a dark net link you need to be very focused! You do this:</p><ol><li>Describe <strong>exactly</strong> what you want to have</li><li>Search on <a href="https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/">DuckDuckGo</a> to get something like this on reddit</li><li>If you not found find dark net wiki and find the right category</li><li>If you still not found post an request on reddit on r/onion for example</li><li>Go on the website and stay on it, be aware of suspicious links.</li></ol><p>How to be anonymous on internet not by using onion? I made a post for that: <a href="http://localhost:2368/anonymous/">http://localhost:2368/anonymous/</a></p><h3 id="example-of-links">Example of links</h3><p>To go to the darknet you just need to install Tor on your computer. Or Brave. </p><p>If you use Brave you need to do the shortcut CTRL+ALT+N to open the private browsing with Tor. </p><p>Then you need links.

There are 2 database that I know someone who have been pwned by on of these databases.

For example a Paypal or Gmail account could be hacked this way.</p><h2 id="how-could-they-get-this-data">How could they get this data</h2><p>There is many ways that hackers get data, like said above using phreaking but also by directly pirating the website using a security breach, brute force a website that does not have captcha or a maximum number of tries by trying every knows passwords or syntax. This is called dictionary attack. </p><p>Once you have been hacked you are added to the hacker's database. The hacker can also tries to access to data that interest him on other website by trying the password or restart a dictionary attack.</p><p>There is also many ways to get data from users. Have you every noticed that when you go to a train station who have free WiFi there is plenty of other WiFi who have the same name or almost? It is because they configure a computer or a micro computer such as a Raspberry PI3 or Raspberry PI Zero W to be connected to the true network and getting data out of the user. </p><p>If the <em>sniffer</em> is clever he can mix this with phishing because if he create a phishing page who correspond to the request facebook.com he can get another page who with the exact same url who get the credidentials to the hacker because it is the sniffing device who is able to choose what will be the content of the page xyz. He can do sniffing with any website. </p><p>We will probably talk more about this topic in another post. </p><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><p>These are the sources and news where I got the informations

id="haveibeenpwned">Haveibeenpwned</h2><p>Haveibeenpwned is a website that is the source of Firefox Monitor to  use it is very simple just write the address to check and it gives pus  down on which sites you have been hacked.</p><p>Example when I type my address I see this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://t3chc4t.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/screenshot-from-2019-11-07-10-49-16.png?w=1100" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot from 2019-11-07 10-49-16.png"></figure><p>If I type another, I come across this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://t3chc4t.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/screenshot-from-2019-11-07-10-51-57.png?w=1100" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot from 2019-11-07 10-51-57.png"></figure><p>I will come back later to the 2nd site Exploit.In in the anecdotes because this site is quite interresting and mysterious.</p><h2 id="the-firefox-monitor">The FireFox Monitor</h2><p>The Firefox Monitor is more in a process of direct protection of the users.  When you go to a pirate site you will be notified by a notification from Firefox asking if you have an account on this site.</p><p>But the real reason why I like this site is that it gives <strong>all the</strong> <strong>sites of the database.</strong></p><p>Indeed when you go to the <a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://monitor.firefox.com/breaches&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265,15700271,15700280,15700283&amp;usg=ALkJrhh05y4TcD-cB3vrUZ8uslkckrFgLA" rel="noopener">Breaches</a> tab you find the list of all sites that have been leaked.</p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works?</h2><p>Before going on to the anecdotes here is how this works.  One might wonder how these sites can know which sites have been visited.</p><p>When a site gets hacked the hacker who is behind this hack sells or releases the site's password database.  Haveibeenpwned uses the logic of antivirus by adding hacker databases  in their own database to be able to cover more site and security.</p><p>The reason why hackers are interested in sites as futile as minecraft  launcher is because often many people use the same passwords for all  accounts.  Thus the hacker can access emails or paypal or leboncoin.</p><h2 id="anecdotes">Anecdotes</h2><p>I recommend that you review the various hacked sites.  You will see that you know full!</p><p>Here is my compilation of funny stuff that I found:</p><h3 id="hackers-hackers">Hackers hackers</h3><p>Several sites of DDOS or leaks of Internet sites have been hacked by other hackers like Void.to or other sites of its kind.</p><p>On the other side, on the side of anti-virus.  You will be able to admire that Avast or MalwareBytes are in the database of stolen passwords.</p><h3 id="known-sites">Known sites</h3><p>There are many known sites in this database.  To believe that they have all been there:</p><p>Patreon, Kickstarter, Yahoo, Epic Games, Pinguin Club, Open CS: GO,  Dailymotion, Utorrent, BitTorrent, Aternos, MalwareBytes, Avast, Bitly,  Dominos (yes I'm talking about pizzas), Forbes, Snapchat, XSpilt, Adobe,  Vodaphone, Tesco, YouPorn, Imgur, Tumblr, Dropbox, Disqus (way to write  comments on many sites, you will recognize easily), League of Legends,  Linkedin, Lastfm, Vk (Russian facebook), baby names (yes there are  hackers interressed by baby names) and finally ...

You will have no excuses at the end of this story.</p><h3 id="how-long-does-learning-takes">How long does learning takes</h3><blockquote>According to some studies learning takes 10 000 hours. . . </blockquote><p>10 000 hours! It is a full time job for years! But what people don't know with this study, it is that this study is based on <strong>pros</strong>, so 10 000 hours is to acquire a skill at a <strong>professional hyper-competitive scale.</strong> But it's not your goal.</p><p>But to just learn something at a satisfying scale to be able to say: "<em>I am not the best but what I've done is good!</em>" </p><blockquote>It takes <strong>20</strong> <strong>hours</strong>. So less than 1 hour per day for 1 month! It is not so much!</blockquote><p>So there is some steps to do to get the most out of the 20 hours of learning you got. </p><ol><li>You need to set your goal clearly</li><li>Then dividing your work into smaller parts</li><li>Then removing distractions to be focused on your task</li><li>Work 20 hours by your divided schedule, the hardest part: the <strong>habit</strong></li></ol><p>The reason of why is it 20 hours is because 20 hours is the time to understand the concept of the skill and overpass the grand barrier of procrastination and is the most efficient time to learn something. Everything you will do after will makes you learn, but slower than before.</p><h3 id="how-can-we-create-a-working-project">How can we create a working project?</h3><p>You don't want to learn something good in 20 hours but creating a fully functional project without needing to make plenty of other to be ready to create your final one?</p><p>It is my case! I really am interested by the NaNoWriMo contest.</p><p>By following the NaNoWriMo style of things it will makes you more able to achieve your project an needed skill to learn your main skill. Also I know that any stories can be rebuilt from scratch and giving something actually good. </p><p>I also love the NNWM's slogan: "Every story matters...". It is a really powerful slogan that works for other skills too!</p><p>So this is the procedure to be competitive with yourself and create your project faster: </p><ol><li><strong>Define</strong> your project as clearly as you can to have a clear idea on what it should be at the end. Also try to get inspiration before writing and get out your comfort zone!</li><li>Give yourself a <strong>quantity</strong>, for example with the NNWM contest it is 50 000 words, if you really wants to progress you can set a large quantity or creating multiple little quantities. Like you prefer. I already saw peoples who created a music from scratch in one year without doing other projects at the same time...</li><li>And according to the 2 precedent steps what would be the perfect <strong>deadline</strong> for you?</li><li><strong>Divide</strong> your works and start planning</li><li>Tell to your friends and family what you are doing. It will get 2 things for sure: <strong>feedback</strong>, proud, <strong>motivation</strong>.</li><li>Starts practicing your skill every day like you done your schedule. I recommend you to add it into your reminders of your phone and writing always at the same hour in the same place. It will be easier to create a habit. <em>An action  takes 66 days to become an habit...</em></li><li>Get feedback and makes other drafts until your deadline then publish your work on internet, even if you think it is not good enough to you.</li></ol><p>So with these steps you should be able to create your project so I know a french YouTuber who wrote a book using the NNWM challenge. He started for 1 month of intense writing, then 1 month of corrections, then 1 month of re-correction with his editor and finally publishing. He created his book from start to finish in less than 1 year. </p><p>Another thing you can do is creating a group of people to create your stuff together!</p><blockquote>If your project fails it is not dramatic, 1 is better than 0. You acquired lots of experience anyway and you would be ready to try again. This is a great skill alone : )</blockquote><p>One thing is sure, stop over-thinking like me and like you are doing right now and start something you imagine(d), you will correct mistakes later, but don't stop! </p><p>Like said a creator from the YouTube Creator Academy said that she wrote a script that have no sense and she could not even find a title less than  a whole sentence to explain it, after a certain time of transformation she done it anyway and her video was working correctly!</p><p>Note that the NaNoWriMo contest is totally compatible with the 20 hours. Because to write 1667 words it takes you at least 1 hour if you type fast so you are writing more than 20 hours in a month using NNWM. Anyway just do it and be happy of the result because <em>every story matters</em>...</p><p>And of course when the deadline is finished and your work published you can update it, except if it is a video of course.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h2><p>To finish this story I would say that if you want to create something efficient just start and create deadlines and other stuff like I said above, then re-write the story until your are happy of the result. So don't be afraid like I am to ask for support and feedback, it will makes you progress in your style and skill!</p><blockquote>If you really wants to progress in a skill set deadlines to be more efficient! It is the best way of doing things , to have a clear vision on what you need to do and when!</blockquote><p>Hope you enjoyed this post and thanks you so much to read it!</p><p>And like a blogger that I couldn't find anymore (because my memory is  a black hole): </p><blockquote>Write to express not to impress.</blockquote><h3 id="my-inspirations-and-sources">My inspirations and sources</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MgBikgcWnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p><a href="https://goinswriter.com/tips-writing-book/">https://goinswriter.com/tips-writing-book/</a></p><p>The book of the french YouTuber "Fabien Olicard"</p><p><a href="https://nanowrimo.org/"><a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">https://nanowrimo.org/</a></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
