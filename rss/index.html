It's the autobiography of Ed Snowden called "Permanent Record". This book, that I found in French (I am Belgian) is called "Mémoire Vive" in French and what's wrote under it is "The man who risked his life to disclose the global mass surveillance".</p><blockquote>Nothing will ever be removed</blockquote><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p><em>In 2013 a 29 man called Edward Snowden, surprise the world by disclosing that the USA had the project to collect all of our phone calls, text, emails and more to build a global mass surveillance program, never made on earth. Could be able to look deep in the privacy of everybody on earth. Six years later Snowden reveals for the first time how he participated in the building of this program and how he disclosed it to the world.</em></p><p><em>"Permanent Record" is the amazing story of a smart child who has grown-up "online", a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and the awareness of the internet.</em></p><p>It will become a classic of our times.</p><h2 id="what-is-it-about">What is it about?</h2><p>The Permanent Record explains all the life of Ed Snowden, from his childhood to where he is today. It describes also how the CIA and NSA work so if you like that you will have also background details.</p><p>I will not describe this book in detail so please buy it!</p><h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2><p>When the book came up in the USA the government wanted to claim all the rewards from the book because of the old actions of Snowden.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I don't want to describe all the book so if you are interested in open-source, mass surveillance, Tor, anonymous on the internet, and Snowden itself.</p><p>I am interested in all of this, in fact, my nickname is a contraction of Snowden and Code.</p><p>If you want to get this book you can get it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250237238/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_4oiYDbD3C8BKQ">Amazon</a> or in the library (go in a library to discover other nice books).</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The king of all browsers - Brave]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>You don't like Chrome but you appreciate how fast it is.

But you want more privacy, you appreciate Tor for its privacy but you want fast browsing. Then welcome to Brave.</p><p>Brave is an <strong>open-source</strong> browser based on Chromium so it gets as fast as Chrome, but even more, because it also has a tracker-blocker, ad-blocker and tier-party cookies blocker. So it is even faster.</p><h2 id="fast-ad-free-freedom">Fast, ad-free, freedom</h2><p>Brave is fast because of Chromium and the tracker-blocker. So all ads from Google are blocked and the cookies who go with too. It creates a more readable page and faster browsing because the page is <em>fresh</em> and free from any trackers who goes with.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-10-12-22-46.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The homepage of Brave displaying the stats</figcaption></figure><h2 id="tor-integration">Tor integration</h2><p>You want even more private mode, then you will love the super-private mode. I've already talked about it before in my other posts, you can access it by pressing ALT+SHIFT+N. You are into a browsing mode with DuckDuckGo (no tracking with Google then) and Tor (even less tracking).<br>If you activate this mode and do not use accounts and do not download anything then you got an anonymous experience because of Tor, your behaviour and because no data is stored on your computer, so nobody knows what you visited.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-10-12-43-27.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>ALT+SHIFT+N</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-10-12-43-55.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Check if Tor works with check.torproject.org</figcaption></figure><h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2><p>Some don't want to go on Brave because they want the Chrome extensions. They don't get a point. Brave is based on Chromium, Chromium can install the Chrome extensions, so Brave can too. They are well integrated with Brave.</p><p>I use these Chrome extensions: Dark Reader, Sprint Reader, MetaMask, Onion Browser Button (go on Tor all the time), Privacy Pass (skipping the Cloudflare captchas), Enhancer for Youtube.</p><p>So if you are stopped from Brave for the extensions, comes, you can get most of the extensions of the internet!</p><h2 id="open-source">Open source</h2><p>Brave is open source, the goal of Brave is to be more than a user and to control your digital activities. You can get more info about Brave on the official GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser">https://github.com/brave/brave-browser</a></p><p>Brave is available for all platforms such as Windows, OSX, Linux (yeah, love it), Android and IOS. But the mobile versions don't benefit from all features like Tor browsing for example. But they're good too!</p><h2 id="basic-attention-token-bat-">Basic Attention Token (BAT) </h2><p>Finally, the basic attention token is a way to remunerate the other users of Brave. You can buy them or get them by the attention that you have to Brave ads (one per, day, hour, you decide) you can also disable this features if you want a 100% ad-free experience.</p><p>Even if I never saw one single add from Brave or anything else I got tokens. Don't know from where they come I gots 4.4 BAT. Note that these have a deadline, to make sure you spend them for other creators and not accumulate them. I love this concept too!</p><p>You can also activate the auto-contribute but I don't know too much about it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-10-12-38-24.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The BAT settings</figcaption></figure><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I highly recommend to switch on Brave now!

So you wanted to get a new homepage like lots of launchers. But what I will talk about today is a unique launcher that is small, battery-friendly, smart and fast (open source)</p><blockquote>This is KISS launcher, it means </blockquote><blockquote>Keep It Simple &amp; Stupid</blockquote><h2 id="why">Why </h2><p>I decided to use KISS because the concept is to not needs to get widgets and sort your apps on your home screen. So KISS is only a few things,</p><ul><li>A favorite toolbar</li><li>An history</li><li>An intelligent search bar (With an settings and application button)</li></ul><h2 id="the-intelligent-search-bar">The intelligent search bar</h2><p>The intelligent search bar can do many things like calculating, opening an app, calling or texting contact just by the name, calling a phone number, browse the web.</p><p>This intelligent toolbar remembers what are your habits it will display the most used apps before the less used ones, don't care about alphabetical order.</p><p>This intelligent toolbar also contains a setting button on the right where you can get the KISS settings and the device settings.</p><p>It also contains an application button, it is a green circle (like the KISS logo) and displays all applications in alphabetical order to be more easy to find apps that we don't know the name.</p><h2 id="the-kiss-settings">The KISS settings</h2><p>In the settings, there is also many interesting. </p><p>There are basic things like the search settings where you can set up your search providers, unchecked things that can be searched. </p><p>You can personalise the UI settings like activating the minimalist UI you can get more information in the settings</p><p>You can personalise pretty much anything related to KISS launcher. </p><h2 id="why-1">Why?</h2><h3 id="small">Small</h3><p>KISS is really small for a launcher most of the launcher is more than 500 MB this launcher is less than 10 MB at total.</p><h3 id="battery-friendly">Battery-friendly</h3><p>The launcher doesn't consume lots of battery but if your phone is rooted you can also have additional feature like hibernating apps to consume even less power in the background.</p><h3 id="smart">Smart</h3><p>Like we said about the search bar, the search bar contains different simple but useful in everyday life features.</p><h3 id="fast">Fast</h3><p>The launcher is small and consumes less battery so obviously as simple it is, it is really fast and never crashes.</p><h2 id="open-source">Open-Source</h2><p>This app is open-source you can get the source over there: <a href="https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/">https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/</a></p><p>Then if you want to install it, it is available on Play Store but also on F-Droid (a store for free and open-source apps) or  you can directly download it via APK on the F-Droid page: <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.neamar.kiss/">https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.neamar.kiss/</a></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>If you're looking for a simple and stupid home page and launcher for your Android device you can use KISS, you will love it!</p><p>I hope this post interested you and you will download KISS if you're on an Android  phone.</p><p>See you!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to publish a local website]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In this post I have been tried to publish my blog, failed.

So I decided to return to basics. The static website. This blog doesn't have something very dynamic excepted writing. All other integrations are tier-party so not dynamic from this website.</p><p>I've already done that with a WordPress website.</p><h2 id="what-does-static-means">What does static means?</h2><p>There are two types of websites, dynamics one and statics one.</p><p>Dynamic websites are like WordPress, Google, Ghost, Medium, etc. There has direct contact with the user, also the server needs to receive a request and often needs a database and JavaScript.</p><p>A static website has no database, no needs to have a server or JavaScript to run. Files can be downloaded and run locally on your computer. Using a tool called Wget you can convert dynamic websites like blogs or business websites into static websites.</p><p>Also in this way you will have 3 backups, on your host, on your computer and on the dynamic website.</p><h2 id="create-your-local-installation">Create your local installation</h2><p>You need to choose what will be your website it cannot be something else than text without interactions. Example: Blog or Pro Website. So you can't have a wiki for example. Your wiki will be in "READ ONLY" mode.</p><p>So if you want an example go check my other post about Ghost, I made a local installation.</p><h2 id="choose-a-host">Choose a host</h2><p>You need something to host your website. You can use GitHub pages, Netifly, or simply on your raspberry pi using Nginx. I will talk about this last one later</p><h2 id="create-a-script">Create a script</h2><p>Now we need a script to convert our local website into static files.‌</p><ol><li>Create a sync folder like "ghosthtml"<br></li><li>Run: (replace ghost-up by something else if you want. )</li></ol><pre><code class="language-shell">sudo gedit /usr/bin/ghost-up 
</code></pre><p>3. Copy and paste the following code into it:</p><pre><code class="language-shell">cd ~/ghosthtml 
wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent http://localhost:2368 
cd localhost*
</code></pre><p>4. Replace the <em>ghosthtml</em> and <em>URL</em> if it's not correct to you</p><p>5. Then add the publish commands into your file:</p><pre><code class="language-shell">git init
git remote add origin https://HOST/USER/REPO
git add --all
git commit -m website
git config credential.helper store
git push -u origin master
</code></pre><p>6. Save the file and allow executing file:</p><pre><code class="language-shell">sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/ghost-up
</code></pre><p>7. Run the command <code>ghost-up</code> to publish your content</p><h2 id="configure-the-raspberry-pi">Configure the Raspberry PI</h2><p>If you decided to use a Rpi  you can follow this guide to  sync the host with the Rpi.</p><ol><li>First, install Nginx on it <em>sudo apt install nginx -y</em></li><li>Then go into the Nginx folder <em>cd /var/www/html</em></li><li>Then sync the repo by running the following commands:‌‌</li></ol><pre><code class="language-shell">watch -n 3600 sudo rm -r /var/www/html/* &amp;&amp; sudo git clone https://HOST/USER/REPO /var/www/html</code></pre><p>4. Configure your modem ports to allow the port 80 to work</p><p>5. Configure a DDNS like Noip to be linked to your public IP address</p><h2 id="use-it">Use it</h2><p>So now your script has been made you just need to make changes on your local install and then running ghost-up to be published. In maximum 1 hour the change will be made on your Rpi, and in max 5 minutes for the GitHub Pages.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Congratulation, you have a fast, secure static website who can work on any device and cannot be hacked excepted the git repo. </p><p>So you just need to run one command to publish all changes! And you've also learned how to configure a Rpi. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ghost exited with code 0]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I was writing the precedent post about Ghost and I wanted to test how to publish this website.

So hackers will probably not think about Master as a password manager, cannot hack it or hack database because no data is stored. </p><p>If they pwned you on a website you are protected, you just need to change the password you have on this website, all other websites are safe because they don't have the same password! </p><p>I highly recommend you to test it with the online app.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Create a Minecraft Server]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This is a complete guide to explain you how to create a Minecraft Server</p><p>You got multiple choices of Servers:</p><p>Spigot/CraftBukkit: Plugins, like mod but more stable and without needing to install it on the client</p><p>Vanilla: Official version and the latest one, no mod, no plugin</p><p>Forge Server:</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/create-a-minecraft-server/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5dc5b47729f4ec2178df3c20</guid><category><![CDATA[Tutorial]]></category><category><![CDATA[Apps]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[SnowCode]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2019 19:26:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a complete guide to explain you how to create a Minecraft Server</p><p>You got multiple choices of Servers:</p><p>Spigot/CraftBukkit: Plugins, like mod but more stable and without needing to install it on the client</p><p>Vanilla: Official version and the latest one, no mod, no plugin</p><p>Forge Server: The less stable and the worst, you need to install the mods on the server and every clients needs to have mods installed too.</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>You need e few things before starting:</p><ul><li>A computer (to optimize: try one you're not using when playing)</li><li>Java installed</li><li>Root access to the modem</li></ul><h2 id="windows">Windows</h2><h3 id="vanilla">Vanilla</h3><p>The vanilla server is the easiest one you just need one file and it is very handy to create a server with this tool.</p><ol><li>Download the server file on <a href="https://mcversions.net/">https://mcversions.net/</a> by clicking on server jar.</li><li>Create a new folder for your server</li><li>Put your server file into it.</li><li>Run it with java runtime and wait a while</li><li>Open eula.txt and replace false by true (then save)</li><li>When the console starts write stop</li><li>Open server.properties and go one by one all settings, and set online-mode to false if you want crack to be allowed.

Many videos are talking about "Mystery Boxes found on the dark web", drug, serial killers, black market, etc.</p><p>Let's demystify all of this!</p><h2 id="what-is-the-dark-web">What is the dark web</h2><p>There are many dark webs. Many peoples have confusion with the term dark web and deep web. The deep web corresponds to anything stored on the internet but not visible with Google.</p><p>For example, your mailbox, if you search your email address on another computer you will not be able to check your emails without login. Then congratulation! You're on the deep web!</p><p>But the dark web is another thing. There are many dark webs and they need specific software to run and to be watched. These are usually anonymous and were also made to represent the <em>golden age</em> of the internet.</p><p>The Golden Age of the internet represents the time before people should consider they virtual life like they real life; when capitalism didn't take the internet; when NSA was not watching the internet to find terrorists.</p><p>This corresponds to the time before this dark time of the 11 September 2001.</p><h2 id="the-dark-web">The dark web?</h2><p>First, you need to say: "which one" There are many dark webs. Freenet, Tor, Dat, IPFS, ZeroNet, etc.</p><p>The most popular dark web is probably Tor. Against many other dark web tor is NOT decentralised. Tor is masking your identity using a special proxy called "Tor Proxy" (very original, yeah).</p><p>If you want to understand how Tor works you can check my other post on how to be anonymous on the internet and how.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-find-on-the-dark-web">What can you find on the dark web?</h2><p>In the dark web, you can found many things that represent the human being. So you can find illegals things but also very good things.</p><p>Private messengers for peoples who are under high surveillance like China for example.</p><p>Platform to communicate sensitives info to the journalists via SecureDrop, in fact, SecureDrop has been developed by Edward Snowden.</p><p>A platform developed by Tor themselves to send data like WeTransfer, but under the Tor network.</p><p>You also have blogs on the dark web, peoples are interested to run blogs under the dark web because it can target a very specific audience, and also because the .onion extension is free. Same things for other decentralised platforms.</p><h2 id="why-tor">Why Tor</h2><p>Tor is not only made to create illegal activities but to be yourself, this is an amazing tool against commercial targeting, censored content, mass surveillance.</p><p>It is like a knife, you can use a knife to cook, or to kill somebody. It is not, for this reason, we will ban knives in the markets. This is only a tool you can use it as you want.</p><p>You can also browse normal websites with Tor of course!</p><h2 id="next-step">Next step?</h2><p>I will also post another post about the topic of the dark web because my blog has not been published yet and what that blog to be available on Tor and the classic internet.</p><h2 id="how-to-go-on-the-dark-web">How to go on the dark web</h2><p><strong>Do not only focus on the dark web, know that you can go, but get the power of browsing the clear net like it was on the dark web because it is! You are anonymous (don't use an account)</strong></p><p>Also, when you search for a dark web link you need to be very focused! You do this:</p><ol><li>Describe <strong>exactly</strong> what you want to have</li><li>Search on <a href="https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/">DuckDuckGo</a> to get something like this on Reddit</li><li>If you not found find a dark web wiki and find the right category</li><li>If you still not found post a request on Reddit on r/onion.</li><li>Go on the website and stay on it, be aware of suspicious links.</li></ol><p>How to be anonymous on the internet not by using onion? I made a post for that: <a href="http://localhost:2368/anonymous/">http://localhost:2368/anonymous/</a></p><h3 id="example-of-links">Example of links</h3><p>To go to the dark web you just need to install Tor on your computer. Or Brave.</p><p>If you use Brave you need to do the shortcut CTRL+ALT+N to open the private browsing with Tor.</p><p>Then you need links. This is the problem with Tor is that without links you can't do anything so I will give you some:</p><p>DuckduckGo browser: <a href="https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/">https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/">https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/</a> (remember that it is not because you use Facebook on the dark web that you are anonymous because you have an account)</p><p>Proton Mail: <a href="https://protonirockerxow.onion/login">https://protonirockerxow.onion/login</a></p><p>The New York Time: <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/">https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/</a></p><p>CryptoDogs (private com): <a href="http://doggyfipznipbaia.onion/">http://doggyfipznipbaia.onion/</a></p><p>Anyway: Get the full list on <a href="https://www.thedarkweblinks.com/tor-links/">https://www.thedarkweblinks.com/tor-links/</a></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>So now you know what is the dark web, if you go on the dark web please be aware that illegal websites come up, cause of the reputation of the dark web illegal content goes there anyway. Sad but true anyway so be aware.</p><p>You will not find too hard content without looking after it but VERY controversial like weed, guns and more.</p><p>But there are also legal websites. And also lots of discontinued websites, don't think it is your connection who is down, lots of websites on the dark web are down.</p><p>When you go on the dark web remember to be very focused and knowing what you want.</p><p>Thanks for reading this post!</p><p>Have fun and never stop learning guys!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to create a cryptocurrency]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrencies made lots of noise these days.

You could be owned. If you want to know more about this topic you can go to this post.</p><h2 id="leaked-password-databases">Leaked Password Databases</h2><p>Databases are used for lots of things the Antivirus Database collects all data from well known malware, so one time it's detected it is blocked by the antivirus. </p><p>But hackers use databases too, they cannot do database of Antivirus to hack, but they can make <strong>leaked password database. </strong></p><p>A leaked password database is shown on haveibeenpwned when the website concerned is not shown, so the website gives the name of the database it's coming from. There are 2 databases that I know someone who have been owned by one of these databases. Exploit.in and Anti-Public List</p><p>The Anti-Public List Database contains 111 text files totalling 24 GB of leaked passwords, emails and credit cards, <em><strong>593,427,119 unique emails addresses linked to passwords.</strong></em></p><p>The data collectors hackers like phreakers sell these databases, example this database is or was for sale on the dark net using bitcoins for €200. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://t3chc4t.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/screenshot-from-2019-11-07-10-51-57.png?w=1100" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot from 2019-11-07 10-51-57.png"><figcaption>An example of how the leaked password database is shown on haveibeenpwned.com</figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-are-they-doing-that">Why are they doing that?</h2><p>Why does hacker  cares  about your League Of Legends, Epic Games or Baby Names account? </p><p>Because lots of peoples are too lazy to use different password for each site, so they can hack much more sensitive data using a Baby Name account. For example a PayPal or Gmail account could be hacked this way.</p><h2 id="how-could-they-get-this-data">How could they get this data</h2><p>There are many ways that hackers get data, like said above using phreaking but also by directly pirating the website using a security breach, brute force a website that does not have captcha or a maximum number of tries by trying every knows passwords or syntax. This is called dictionary attack. </p><p>Once you have been hacked you are added to the hacker's database. The hacker can also try to access to data that interest him on other website by trying the password or restart a dictionary attack.</p><p>There is also many ways to get data from users. Have you every noticed that when you go to a train station who have free Wi-Fi there is plenty of other Wi-Fi who have the same name or almost? It is because they configure a computer or a micro computer such as a Raspberry PI3 or Raspberry PI Zero W to be connected to the true network and getting data out of the user. </p><p>If the <em>sniffer</em> is clever he can mix this with phishing because if he creates a phishing page who correspond to the request facebook.com he can get another page who with the exact same URL who get the credentials to the hacker because it is the sniffing device who is able to choose what will be the content of the page XYZ. He can go sniffing with any website. </p><p>We will probably talk more about this topic in another post. </p><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><p>These are the sources and news where I got the information

logic of antivirus by adding hacker databases  in their own database to be able to cover more site and security.</p><p>The reason why hackers are interested in sites as futile as Minecraft  launcher

You will have no excuses at the end of this story.</p><h3 id="how-long-does-learning-takes">How long does learning takes</h3><blockquote>According to some studies learning takes 10 000 hours. . . </blockquote><p>10 000 hours! It is a full time job for years! But what people don't know with this study, it is that this study is based on <strong>pros</strong>, so 10 000 hours is to acquire a skill at a <strong>professional hyper-competitive scale.</strong> But it's not your goal.</p><p>But to just learn something at a satisfying scale to be able to say: "<em>I am not the best but what I've done is good!</em>" </p><blockquote>It takes <strong>20</strong> <strong>hours</strong>. So less than 1 hour per day for 1 month! It is not so much!</blockquote><p>So there is some steps to do to get the most out of the 20 hours of learning you got. </p><ol><li>You need to set your goal clearly</li><li>Then dividing your work into smaller parts</li><li>Then removing distractions to be focused on your task</li><li>Work 20 hours by your divided schedule, the hardest part: the <strong>habit</strong></li></ol><p>The reason of why is it 20 hours is because 20 hours is the time to understand the concept of the skill and overpass the grand barrier of procrastination and is the most efficient time to learn something. Everything you will do after will makes you learn, but slower than before.</p><h3 id="how-can-we-create-a-working-project">How can we create a working project?</h3><p>You don't want to learn something good in 20 hours but creating a fully functional project without needing to make plenty of other to be ready to create your final one?</p><p>It is my case! I really am interested by the NaNoWriMo contest.</p><p>By following the NaNoWriMo style of things it will makes you more able to achieve your project an needed skill to learn your main skill. Also I know that any stories can be rebuilt from scratch and giving something actually good. </p><p>I also love the NNWM's slogan: "Every story matters...". It is a really powerful slogan that works for other skills too!</p><p>So this is the procedure to be competitive with yourself and create your project faster: </p><ol><li><strong>Define</strong> your project as clearly as you can to have a clear idea on what it should be at the end. Also try to get inspiration before writing and get out your comfort zone!</li><li>Give yourself a <strong>quantity</strong>, for example with the NNWM contest it is 50 000 words, if you really wants to progress you can set a large quantity or creating multiple little quantities. Like you prefer. I already saw peoples who created a music from scratch in one year without doing other projects at the same time...</li><li>And according to the 2 precedent steps what would be the perfect <strong>deadline</strong> for you?</li><li><strong>Divide</strong> your works and start planning</li><li>Tell to your friends and family what you are doing. It will get 2 things for sure: <strong>feedback</strong>, proud, <strong>motivation</strong>.</li><li>Starts practicing your skill every day like you done your schedule. I recommend you to add it into your reminders of your phone and writing always at the same hour in the same place. It will be easier to create a habit. <em>An action  takes 66 days to become an habit...</em></li><li>Get feedback and makes other drafts until your deadline then publish your work on internet, even if you think it is not good enough to you.</li></ol><p>So with these steps you should be able to create your project so I know a french YouTuber who wrote a book using the NNWM challenge. He started for 1 month of intense writing, then 1 month of corrections, then 1 month of re-correction with his editor and finally publishing. He created his book from start to finish in less than 1 year. </p><p>Another thing you can do is creating a group of people to create your stuff together!</p><blockquote>If your project fails it is not dramatic, 1 is better than 0. You acquired lots of experience anyway and you would be ready to try again. This is a great skill alone : )</blockquote><p>One thing is sure, stop over-thinking like me and like you are doing right now and start something you imagine(d), you will correct mistakes later, but don't stop! </p><p>Like said a creator from the YouTube Creator Academy said that she wrote a script that have no sense and she could not even find a title less than  a whole sentence to explain it, after a certain time of transformation she done it anyway and her video was working correctly!</p><p>Note that the NaNoWriMo contest is totally compatible with the 20 hours. Because to write 1667 words it takes you at least 1 hour if you type fast so you are writing more than 20 hours in a month using NNWM. Anyway just do it and be happy of the result because <em>every story matters</em>...</p><p>And of course when the deadline is finished and your work published you can update it, except if it is a video of course.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h2><p>To finish this story I would say that if you want to create something efficient just start and create deadlines and other stuff like I said above, then re-write the story until your are happy of the result. So don't be afraid like I am to ask for support and feedback, it will makes you progress in your style and skill!</p><blockquote>If you really wants to progress in a skill set deadlines to be more efficient! It is the best way of doing things , to have a clear vision on what you need to do and when!</blockquote><p>Hope you enjoyed this post and thanks you so much to read it!</p><p>And like a blogger that I couldn't find anymore (because my memory is  a black hole): </p><blockquote>Write to express not to impress.</blockquote><h3 id="my-inspirations-and-sources">My inspirations and sources</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MgBikgcWnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p><a href="https://goinswriter.com/tips-writing-book/">https://goinswriter.com/tips-writing-book/</a></p><p>The book of the french YouTuber "Fabien Olicard"</p><p><a href="https://nanowrimo.org/"><a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">https://nanowrimo.org/</a></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
